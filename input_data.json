It can identify members of 7-Eleven’s loyalty program allowing management to offer them tailored promotions. \n \nFrom a store-management perspective, the technology can monitor stock levels on shelves and provide real-time operations performance and competitor analysis, check employees on and off shift and identify unauthorised personnel on site. \n \n“The KanKan implementation at 7-Eleven marks our first major collaboration with Remark,” said CP Group chairman Soopakij Chearavanont. \n \n“The 7-Eleven team evaluated many AI technologies and selected KanKan because it has the most robust platform for meeting business objectives, namely, driving revenues, reducing costs and rapidly improving profit margins.” \n \nRemark Holdings’ CEO and chairman, Kai-Shing Tao said the 7-Eleven partnership represents “an incredible opportunity to implement our KanKan technologies on a massive scale”. \n \nChearavanont told a media briefing that the technology would help the chain cut costs, improve revenues and increase margins. \n \nRemark has promised that no images of human faces will be stored on servers by 7-Eleven, apparently addressing privacy concerns relating to what happens to recordings, something being raised by lobby groups around the world. \n \nThe companies say only facial features – not whole faces – are used to generate data which is encrypted. \n \n“No human faces or images ever leaves the KanKan system or goes on the public network,” the company said."}

{"articleID":33452502453,"title":"Bayer Partners with IRRI to Advance Technologies for Direct Seeded Rice in Asia","content":"The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and Bayer have signed an agreement confirming Bayer’s participation in the Direct Seeded Rice Consortium (DSRC) led by IRRI. \n \nThe DSR is developing a comprehensive, science-based, agronomic package adapted for direct seeded rice production in Asia, making direct seeded rice accessible and widely available to rice farmers, thereby enhancing the economic and ecological sustainability of rice production in Asia. \n \nManual puddled transplanted rice (PTR) is the predominant method of rice production in Asia. Despite benefits associated with this method including good weed control, PTR is a highly resource intensive (labor, water, and energy) practice. Puddled flooded rice systems are also a major methane emitter — an important greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Drudgery involved in manually transplanting rice seedlings in paddy soil, a job which is largely done by women farmers, is also a concern. This contributes to the unwillingness of young people to enter the profession. All these factors are making PTR less sustainable, less profitable, and less attractive to farmers. \n \nDirect seeded rice (DSR) has emerged as an efficient and economically viable alternative to PTR as it saves scarce and expensive resources such as labor and water, and reduces GHG emissions. Recently, DSR has been widely practiced in many Asian countries such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines. Many other countries including South Asia are going through this transition from manual transplanting to mechanized DSR. In the future, with labor and water becoming increasingly scarce and expensive, alternative rice establishment methods which are labor and water efficient, such as DSR, will be the preferred method of rice cultivation. \n \nIRRI has developed a unique technology platform and expertise that will be used to address technical questions and produce a science-based package of technical recommendations and good practices for the development of direct seeded rice in Asia. Closer public-private sector collaboration, as well as inputs from the private and NGO sectors, are required to enhance innovation and optimize a science-based integrated approach on all aspects of direct seeded rice technology. The new DSRC aims at providing a new momentum for such multi-sectoral collaboration to address complex issues related to direct seeded rice. \n \n“Bayer is pleased to partner with IRRI to promote direct seeded rice in Asia,” said Simon Thorsten Wiebusch, Country Group Head for Southeast Asia of Bayer’s Crop Science division, who also sits on the Advisory Board of the DSRC. “Rice is gold for the smallholder farmers in Asia — it is more than just food for them; it is also their livelihood. In line with our smallholder farming initiative, we are happy to join the DSRC, and contribute to the development and promotion of direct seeded rice production through various innovations such as our SeedGrowth offering, mechanization, and digital farming solutions, as well as linking up value chain partners and service providers to the farmers who would have no access otherwise.” \n \n“Innovation in technology is essential to nourish the world in a safe, inclusive and sustainable way,” adds Dr. Remy Bitoun, Head of IRRI Tech Transfer. “To improve food security and sustainability, all stakeholders — public and private — must work together and share their expertise. Our new Public Private Partnership, the DSR, will contribute to improved resource management that will benefit rice farmers and the environment. It will also provide an effective, science-based assessment of new technologies relevant to direct seeding, and impact acceleration of the most promising technologies.” \n \nThe DSRC platform aims to improve crop management practices to maximize the advantages of direct seeded rice. In addition, the DSRC will publicize science-based information on DSR rice technology, including better information to help policymakers define national rice development strategies. Capacity building activities and training activities will also be conducted for both the public and private sectors. \n \nUnder the agreement, Bayer will provide access to Bayer-owned genetic materials (hybrids), seed, and drone technologies, as well as in-kind activities for DSRC research and testing. The DSRC will also contribute to the Sustainable Rice Platform’s objectives. Learn more at www.sustainablerice.org ."}

This will result in an increase in power plant output by around 20 percent. The extensive modernization works is scheduled for comple-tion in mid-2019. \n\nA key determining factor outlined by the plant operator KenGen, the lead-ing electricity producer in Kenya, will be the significant increase in perfor-mance. The modernization concept developed by Voith will also improve the plant's energy balance with the reduced number of electrical consum-ers. Another priority is the ease of maintenance. In future, individual com-ponents can be replaced, if necessary with minimal effort. The replacement of the power plant technology also includes equipping it with a remote con-trolled system, so that electricity generation can be regulated from KenGen headquarters in Nairobi. A particular challenge of the upgrade project is that due to structural conditions all components have to be transported to the lower lying powerhouse using an inclined elevator. \n\nThe machines in the small hydropower plant were originally from Morgan Smith. This company was initially acquired by Allis-Chalmers and subse-quently by Voith. As a result, Voith had all relevant documentation on hand during the planning of the project, which made it much easier to develop a modernization concept. \n\nWith an output of 7.4 MW, the Wanjii facility, which is located around 80 kilometers to the northeast of the Kenyan capital Nairobi, is a good example of the importance of a decentralized energy supply in Africa. In many remote and mountainous regions, similar plants supply people with power and create the basis for their economic and industrial development. \n\nThe importance of hydropower \nRenewable energies are without doubt the most sustainable response to growing global energy requirements. Hydropower plays a crucial role in sustainable and environmentally compatible electricity generation from renewable energies and is the largest renewable energy source for electricity generation worldwide. \nAll over the world it makes an indispensable contribution to a stable power supply and thus to economic and social development in industrialized countries and also in regions seeing strong growth. Since the early days of hydropower exploitation, Voith has been a leading supplier of this technology and is constantly refining and improving it. \n\nAbout the company \nVoith (voith.com) is a global technology group. With its wide range of plants, products, services and digital applications, Voith sets standards in the markets for energy, oil and gas, paper, raw materials and transport & automotive. Founded in 1867, Voith today has more than 19,000 employees and earns 4.2 billion euros in sales. It has locations in over 60 countries and is one of the largest family-owned companies in Europe."}

The company conducting the trials through the University of Maryland and Professor Donald K. Milton, a leader in the study respiratory diseases and transmission. \n \nThe trials seek to identify the “biomarkers” for influenza, which act as organic signatures specific to a disease. This discovery would be a key step forward for NBT technology, which works by identifying biomarkers diseases in exhaled breath, said Ancon Medical CEO Wesley Baker. Once identified, an NBT device could be programmed to search for these biomarkers, providing a fast, affordable, and effective option for influenza screening. \n \n“There are a many exciting possibilities that could emerge from these trials. Imagine how by simply breathing into a tube, you could find the first signs of the flu, catching the disease in its tracks and preventing its spread through early treatment and isolation, “said Baker, adding that the current flu season has demonstrated how easily the disease can spread. \n \n“Early detection can help curtail the spread of the flu and save lives in the process. This year’s flu season shows what problems the rapid spread of the virus can cause. Ancon Medical is working to be part of a solution,” Baker added. \n \nHealth officials have described this year’s flu season as especially harsh , with two strains of the virus circulating simultaneously, creating elevated numbers of hospital visits and deaths. The U.S. Center of Disease Control estimates that the seasonal disease can claim the lives of as many as 646,000 around the globe each year. Furthermore, the H3N2 flu virus strain that is circulating is more virulent than other common strains, reducing the effectiveness of the flu shot and increasing spread through human contact, the CDC reported. \n \n“This year’s influenza season shows not only how quickly the disease can spread through human contact, but also how the flu shot isn’t always an effective way to halt the spread of the disease,” Baker said. “Dr. Donald Milton is an expert on how diseases spread, with extensive study into influenza, and his experience and perspective will guide Ancon Medical’s first human trials and the search for the influenza biomarker.” \n \nIn leading the trials, Dr. Milton brings more than 30 years of experience in environmental and occupational respiratory epidemiology, toxicology, and infectious disease transmission. His expertise is in health outcomes measurement in respiratory epidemiology, including exhaled breath analysis of gases and exposure assessment. His work has focused on understanding how the lung generates particles and studying the best ways to sample these particles while preserving their biological properties. \n \nMilton’s most recent work includes a thorough study with his University of Maryland School of Public Health colleagues that shows influenza can be transmitted simply through exhaled breath, not coughing or sneezing, as was previously thought. The study, which was the subject of a Time Magazine story , showed that the aerosol particles collected from sick students’ breath also contained the flu virus, demonstrating that the disease can spread more easily than previously thought. \n \n“The first signs of this disease can be found in the breath, and Dr. Milton is the ideal candidate to lead these trials into how NBT technology can be used to reduce the impact of flu epidemics,” Baker said. “He has devoted his career to studying how the lungs work and how disease affects them. We’re excited to see how his experience can contribute to the growth of NBT technology.” \n \nOnce the influenza biomarker is discovered, healthcare professional will be able to program NBT technology to search for the disease’s signature in the breath, Baker said. Researchers have already discovered the biomarkers for more than 400 diseases, from lung cancer and tuberculosis to the Ebola and Zika viruses, all of which could be programmed into an NBT device. \n \nNBT technology works by ionizing a sample, tagging the ions with specially generated nano-objects and then using a laser to count the molecules to identify the chemicals and to gauge concentrations. Ancon Medical uses this technology in an NBT device that can produce unprecedented sensitivities in searching for diseases, while also offering an affordable, versatile solution for many of the challenges facing disease screening. \n \n“With proper training, an NBT device can be used by non-medical personnel to conduct screenings. It’s also affordable enough to be brought into small hospitals and clinics. And discovering additional biomarkers would only make the technology more effective, producing even better outcomes for doctors, medical staff, and most of all, patients,” Baker said. “Ancon Medical is excited about what these human trials can discover and the potential benefit they can bring to healthcare providers around the world.” \n \nAncon Medical , is a subsidiary of Ancon Technologies Ltd., has patents on NBT technology in both the U.S. and U.K. Ancon Medical is a member of Medical Alley, a Medical trade association based in Minnesota. \n  \nShare article on social media or email"}

{"articleID":33597594840,"title":"Barclays Activist Bramson Can Easily Afford to Be a Pacifist","content":"The Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n\n(Bloomberg Gadfly) -- Activist investor Edward Bramson targets companies that are undervalued because of what he calls operational deficiencies . \n\nBarclays Plc certainly fits the bill: the British bank trades at a steep discount to peers, returns on equity are meager and its investment banking arm loses money. But history suggests a radical restructuring -- like a spin-off of the latter business -- isn't on the cards. Holding CEO Jes Staley to his targets, though, would be victory enough. \n\nPast activist tilts at big banks, especially those that involve breaking them up, rarely go to plan. Twitchy regulators and conservative boards tend not to like drastic measures, especially those that might weaken financial support and hurt client confidence. \n\nSwitzerland's UBS Group AG saw  off  Knight Vinke's effort to make it hive off its investment bank. At Credit Suisse Group AG, agitator Rudolf Bohli seems to have toned  down  his rhetoric. It's hard to see Barclays being very different. Any bid to ditch investment banking would be seen as costly and disruptive, especially when weighed against the buybacks and increased dividends Staley is promising. \n\nStaley has, in fact, done a lot of the hard work that activists might have agitated for. The CEO has sold the Africa business, exited retail banking in continental Europe, eliminated jobs and has completed the sale of unwanted assets. Bramson's 10-point plan for Barclays, if ever it materializes, is unlikely to have anything quite as radical on it. \n\nWhere Bramson could help Barclays' long-suffering shareholders is in holding Staley to account in meeting his targets. These include boosting return on tangible equity to more than 9 percent by 2019 from 5.6 percent in  2017 . \n\nGetting there will involve a mix of cutting costs and boosting revenues, especially at the investment bank. Almost 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) of extra revenue could be unlocked if that division's performance was improved, according to UBS analysts. Some of that will depend on volatility normalizing; the rest will depend on how Barclays' investment bankers spend the money they've been allocated. There's scope here for an activist to hold Barclays managers' feet to the fire. \n\nThere is an opportunity for value to be unlocked at Barclays. The bank trades at a 30 percent discount to book value, while most European peers trade at a slight premium, according to Bloomberg data. If the U.K. economy holds up as it has done, if the interest-rate cycle progresses as expected, and if Barclays actually delivers its plan as promised, some of that gap should close. The resolution of past legal woes -- from the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to toxic mortgage bonds -- should provide a tailwind, too. \n\nIf things don't go to plan, it will be time to put on the boxing gloves. Until then, Bramson the activist can afford to be a pacifist. \n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. \n\nLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering finance and markets.

John Cryan, its CEO since summer 2015, and the board are being tested by three consecutive full-year losses and missed cost-cutting targets, as well as high-level tensions over strategy and performance. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal and other media reported this week that Deutsche Bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, has reached out externally to potential candidates to replace Mr. Cryan, citing people briefed on the discussions. The outreach raises the possibility that Mr. Cryan could leave before his contract ends in 2020, \n\nMr. Achleitner didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Cryan didn't address the reports directly, but a day later told employees in a memo the bank made public that he is \"absolutely committed\" to serving the lender and carrying out its turnaround strategy. \n\nOther nominees to the supervisory board are Michele Trogni, former executive at data and analytics firm IHS Markit Ltd. and UBS Group AG, and Mayree Clark, a former longtime Morgan Stanley wealth-management executive, according to the person familiar with the board's plans. \n\nThe fourth nominee is already known: Deutsche Bank previously announced that Norbert Winkeljohann, a an executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, would be nominated to the supervisory board this year. \n\nMr. Thain didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The other nominees weren't immediately reached. Mr. Thain's nomination was earlier reported by Germany's WirtschaftsWoche. \n\nDeutsche Bank, like other German companies, has a dual-board structure. The CEO-led management board is directly responsible for strategy and operations; the supervisory board appoints, oversees and dismisses management-board members. \n\nMr. Thain would bring a long history of experience in financial services, some of it tumultuous. \n\nEarly in his career, he spent more than two decades at Goldman Sachs, working his way up the ranks to chief financial officer and president. In 2004, he became head of the New York Stock Exchange. He then became chief executive of Merrill Lynch in late 2007, when the investment bank was grappling with debilitating mortgage-related losses. \n\nHe helped orchestrate Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp. at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, then lost his job and was lambasted by investors, regulators and politicians for big bonuses paid to Merrill employees. He later told the Journal that he regretted taking the job and having to sell Merrill to Bank of America. \n\nMr. Thain then earned credit for shepherding a turnaround at CIT Group. He left CIT in 2016. \n\nWrite to Jenny Strasburg at [email protected]"}

{"articleID":33596368198,"title":"The newspaper giant of Central Mass.","content":"Chances are now very high daily community news coming out of Central Massachusetts will be from a publication owned by a large media corporation, with a strong commitment to the bottom line. \n \nWith the exception of the Gardner News, six of the seven daily newspapers in the region are owned by multi-publication companies from outside Massachusetts, and in late February the company owning the most and largest of those newspapers – New York-based GateHouse Media, which owns the Worcester Telegram & Gazette, MetroWest Daily News and Milford Daily News – bought out five weekly newspapers and one monthly magazine in the region. \n \nGateHouse's $1.2-million purchase of Millbury-based Holden Landmark Corp. – which operates Worcester Magazine, the Holden Landmark, baystateparent magazine, the Grafton News, the Millbury-Sutton Chronicle and the Leominster Champion – puts more local news under the control of an organization in acquisition-and-cost-cutting mode since it emerged from bankruptcy four years ago. \n \n\"It's a good opportunity for us to really begin to look at how we're utilizing our precious resources and reporting in the field,\" said Telegram Publisher Paul Provost. \n Buy and cut  \nGateHouse's parent company, New Media Investment Group, operates 142 daily newspapers, 326 weekly newspapers and 569 locally focused websites. \n \nIn 2014, GateHouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and out of that emerged New Media. The firm has since spent more than $900 million on acquisitions and increased its dividend 37 percent. \n \nThe company recorded a profit of at least $31.6 million in two of the last three years, and increased revenue from $1.2 billion in 2015 to $1.25 billion in 2016 to $1.34 billion in 2017. \n \nThose increasing revenues and profits have come as New Media has cut costs, including by trimming personnel. \n        \nLast year, it cut operating costs not related to its acquisitions by $42 million, including a $22.5-million decrease in compensation. That trend was true for 2016, when it cut operating costs unrelated to acquisitions by $24.3 million, including a $10.2-million cut in compensation. \n \nThis cost cutting is a relatively common practice among large media companies. Virginia-based Gannett Co., which publishes USA Today and more than 100 daily newspaper throughout the county, had more than $3.1 billion in 2017 revenue and has reported severance costs of $152.8 million since 2015. \n \nAt the Telegram, the newsroom staff is about 120 employees, down from its heyday of 800 in the mid-1980s, although that reduction has come as the media industry has adjusted to the long-term loss of advertising and subscription revenues revenues and under various corporate owners, including The New York Times Co., Florida-based Halifax Media Group and GateHouse. \n \nMark Henderson, a former digital editor at the Telegram, was laid off after the paper's acquisition by Halifax, which bought the paper in 2014 from Boston Red Sox Owner John Henry, only to sell its papers to New Media later that year for $280 million. \n \nChains like GateHouse and Denver-based Digital First Media – the owners of the Fitchburg Sentinel & Enterprise, Lowell Sun and the Boston Herald – have found their niche by driving margin from their properties and returning value to shareholders, Henderson said. \n \n\"Basically, [GateHouse] is at the top of their game in doing that,\" he said. \n \nGateHouse is executing its gameplan, but that may not be best for local community news, with Henderson saying, \"I don't think there's enough investment going on on the content side.\" \n A $1.2M alternative purchase  \nGateHouse's purchase of Holden Landmark gives the company control over another voice in the region: weekly community newspapers and – in the case of Worcester Magazine – a publication founded as the alternative to daily newspapers like the Telegram. \n \nThe Landmark purchase is unique, though, because its publications were already owned by a GateHouse executive. Kirk Davis, GateHouse Media's CEO and COO of New Media, owned the small cluster of papers as a side venture. \n \nThe acquisition \"definitely strengthens [GateHouse's] position in Central Mass.,\" Provost said. \n \nAfter years of Telegram reporters competing against reporters of a company owned by Davis, all can collaborate under one proverbial roof, Provost said. \n \nThe goal, he said, is to preserve those publications, but to also improve upon them. How and if those papers will share editorial content has been yet been decided. \n \nWorcester Magazine's distinct voice adds a different layer to GateHouse's publication portfolio, Davis said. \n \n\"The key to being successful is to be distinctive in what products you offer,\" he said. \"That's been a good formula for the Worcester Magazine, as it has been for community newspapers.\" \n \nDavis said all Landmark staff would be hired by GateHouse initially, \"but how things evolve in months and years ahead will take its course based on how they're doing.\" \n The impact on local newsrooms  \nGateHouse isn't the only Central Mass. newspaper owner cutting operating costs. Denver-based Digital First Media closed the Fitchburg Sentinel & Enterprise office last month, opting to have staff work out of their homes. \n \n\"That's pretty amazing,\" said Dan Kennedy, journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston journalism professor of having employees to work out of their homes. \n \nPracticing journalists acknowledge certain papers would no longer exist if GateHouse or Digital First hadn't stepped in and righted the financial ships, Kennedy said. \n \n\"A lot of it depends on the individual circumstances of each paper, but in general, I think the idea of one corporate entity owned by a hedge fund operating hundreds of local newspapers is not especially good for journalism or society,\" he said. \n \nGateHouse journalists do the best they can with the limited resources, and it's the corporate ownership of these newspaper that is leading to criticism of a decline in local news and a decline in civic participation, said Desmond McCarthy, a journalism professor at Framingham State University and advisor to the student newspaper, which has sent college journalists to GateHouse papers for internships. \n \n\"The major problem is that a national corporation is creating a media monopoly and then engaging in cost-cutting practices that are detrimental to the quality of these news outlets,\" McCarthy said. \n \nThese practices, McCarthy said, lead to poor pay and high turnover in GateHouse's newsrooms. \n \nIn the company's annual report, New Media referenced concern about retaining experienced employees, which is essential to the local journalism world where sourcing and developing relationships are crucial. \n \n\"A shortage of such employees, or our inability to retain such employees, could have an adverse impact on our productivity and costs, our ability to expand, develop and distribute new products and our entry into new markets,\" the company said in the report. \"The cost of retaining or hiring such employees could exceed our expectations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\" \n \nSpencer Buell, a staff writer at Boston Magazine, had his first professional journalism job at the GateHouse weekly Arlington Advocate from 2013 to 2015, making $12.60 an hour working full time. \n \nGateHouse's success with its bottom line can't be denied, but this business model, which is largely the same across the local journalism industry, is discouraging for young journalists, Buell said. \n \n\"I've seen a lot of people get frustrated and leave,\" he said. \"Many leave the industry for good.\" \n Still the local news source, at a profit  \nDespite changes in ownership and a smaller newsroom staff, the Telegram maintains a strong presence in the community and at city hall, said Mike Angelini, chairman of law firm Bowditch & Dewey, who once considered buying the Telegram as part of a local ownership group. \n \n\"I read it every day,\" he said. \"It's still a medium of choice for people interested in what's going on in Worcester.\" \n \nLow wages, layoffs and cuts at companies like GateHouse and Digital First, he said, are a product of the capitalistic society in which we live. \n \n\"It has to earn a profit. Otherwise, there wouldn't be anyone in this business,\" Angelini said."}

At an event in London, both companies were able to make near-real-time bandwidth changes in each other’s production networks. This is the first time two-way network orchestration between carrier production networks has been demonstrated anywhere in the world, and marks an important step in enabling real-time cross-carrier automation. \n \nNext-generation infrastructure – such as software-defined networking – is increasingly being viewed as key to helping organizations better manage network traffic, and improve business agility so that digital transformation can successfully support their strategic business goals. \n \nPeter Konings, EMEA head of product development at Verizon, commented: “Enterprise networking is in the midst of a revolution. Organizations today want intelligent, dynamic networks that respond automatically to their changing business needs. Before today, no-one has been able to demonstrate elastic flexibility across carriers. Today’s demonstration is the first time anyone in the world has been able to flex network capacity in both directions across network boundaries. This will be a game changer for enterprise networking.” \n \nMirko Voltolini, Head of Network On Demand at Colt, said: “This showcase positively demonstrates the power of software defined networking and how increased adoption is putting operators and customers in control of their networks and services. Previously, closed systems have made interoperability between service providers extremely difficult. Further, it validates Colt’s strategy of providing on-demand flexibility to truly enable customers’ digital transformation journeys. Through the use of SDN, providers are now able to better collaborate and innovate, ultimately benefitting customers.” \n \nVerizon and Colt are working with MEF to advance the development of industry standards, in particular inter-carrier business and operational LSO (Lifecycle Service Orchestration) APIs, which will accelerate the availability of this flexibility from many more partner networks. Daniel Bar-Lev, Director Office of the CTO, MEF, added:  “Proof of concept demonstrations and trials of inter-provider service orchestration are critical steps for making agile, assured and orchestrated connectivity services that span multiple operators a reality. We’re delighted to see today’s demonstration moving the service provider industry towards this objective.”"}

{"articleID":33637376467,"title":"University of Central Florida to Run Arecibo Site","content":"The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently announced that a tripartite consortium led by the University of Central Florida (UCF) in partnership with Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Yang Enterprises, Inc. in Oviedo, Florida, will take over management of the Arecibo Observatory. \nThe observatory is home to a 1000-foot (305-meter) radio telescope located in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Its construction was completed in 1963 for research in radio astronomy, atmospheric science, and planetary radar astronomy. Formally known as National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC), it held the largest single-aperture telescope in the world until July 2016 when the 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China was completed. \n\nThe observatory was built in Puerto Rico for reasons of funding, location, and terrain. Because its construction was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, it had to be located in a territory of the United States. It had to be situated near the equator because there radar capable of studying the ionosphere could also be used to study nearby planets and near-Earth asteroids. The Arecibo site also had the advantage of a limestone karst terrain with a natural sinkhole of ideal size and shape for holding the reflector dish. \n\nThe reflector dish sustained minor damage from Hurricane Maria in September 2017. However, this damage was not extensive enough to justify decommissioning the facility. Funding for repairs was secured by Florida Senator Bill Nelson, who stated, “This is a win-win-win. It’s good for UCF and Florida, it’s good for Puerto Rico, and it will enable thousands of scientists who do research at Arecibo each year to continue their work.” \n\nWith its emphasis on STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) curricula and its reputation as a center for space-related research, UCF seems to be a good fit for running the observatory. The school plans to sell time at the observatory to private and public research agencies, seek donations and more partners, and promote tourism to generate revenue. “The observatory will provide a valuable new dimension to space science at UCF while creating more academic opportunities for students and faculty at UCF, in Puerto Rico and beyond,” said UCF President John C. Hitt. Chancellor Carlos M. Padin of Universidad Metropolitana agrees, “We are confident this partnership will expand the opportunities for research, as well as formal and informal STEM education in Puerto Rico.” \n\nThe third partner in the consortium, Yang Enterprises, Inc., will provide facilities infrastructure, engineering, operations, maintenance, information technology and support services, as well as logistics and security services. “This project presents a unique opportunity for Yang Enterprises to support not only space research, but also support the Arecibo community and the educational and scientific communities of the globe,” Founder Tyng-Lin (Tim) Yang said. Mr. Yang earned a Ph.D. in civil engineering at UCF in 1990 and is an adjunct professor in the Civil Engineering Department. \n\nThe Arecibo Observatory is located at: \nRoute 625 Bo. Esperanza, \nArecibo, PR 00612 \n\nThe visitor center is open Wednesday through Sunday and on holidays from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. It is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.

Revenue growth in Europe over the last three fiscal years is over 50%, with year-over-year revenue growth for the most recent fiscal year standing at 66%. \n \n“This is an exciting time for SOTI. People are at the heart of everything we do, so investing in our workforce and giving talented people the platform to innovate, is a key priority for us,” commented Carl Rodrigues, Founder and CEO of SOTI. “This new base in the West Midlands where business is growing faster than any other UK region [3] , makes us ideally placed to respond to the market and establish a workforce for the future.” \n \nCouncillor Stuart Davis, Mayor of Solihull, said: “The scale of investment coming into the West Midlands has rapidly gained momentum in recent years and Solihull is now renowned for attracting both global and UK based companies, with SOTI being the latest example. I am delighted that SOTI has decided to take advantage of the region’s growing opportunities and look forward to seeing its journey continue.” \n \nThe new West Midlands base also signals the company’s commitment to nurturing the development of the local region’s ‘digital natives’ in the months ahead. This demographic group is set to make up 75% of the workforce by 2025 [4] , and SOTI is committed to developing this talent by building partnerships with local schools and establishing a strong internal promotion programme to encourage retention and stability for local talent. \n \nCentral to this programme is employee development, where SOTI’s key values and dynamic company culture come into play. SOTI constantly encourages internal candidates to expand their knowledge and skillset through a variety of dedicated training programmes, while rewarding employees who are eager to innovate in line with the fast-moving technology industry in which the company operates. \n \nOne person who has already experienced this journey is Jordan O’Connor, Manager, Sales Engineers, EMEA, at SOTI. “For a long time, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in IT, but all the jobs I came across seemed to be located in London. However, SOTI took a chance on me and the company has given me opportunities to engage in the business and pushed me to strive for continuous improvement. Now, I get to do what I love and also stay close to my friends and family.” \n \nTo find out more about the career opportunities at SOTI, visit  www.soti.net/about/our-careers /"}

Embraer EMB-145LR aircraft as it travels on the tarmac at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, US. (Bloomberg file photo) \n  \nChicago – A new $8.5-billion plan to expand Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport ran into turbulence due to a gate dispute involving the airport’s two biggest carriers. \n \nBut Mayor Rahm Emanuel vowed to move ahead with the project despite opposition from American Airlines Group, Inc. \n \nThat airline said it cannot sign a new lease needed for the project, citing a provision that gives United Airlines, Inc. five out of eight gates that all parties had agreed to designate for common use as late as Feb. 8. \n \n“United’s last-minute secret deal with the city raises a number of questions and undermines competition and consumer choice,” American said in a statement. “We encourage city leaders to fix the lease and ensure competition remains vibrant at O’Hare.” \n \nChicago-based United called American’s claim “disingenuous” and countered that a deal with the city for five additional gates was reached in 2016. \n \n“Our agreement with the city for five additional gates was made more than 18 months ago in response to American’s deal with city for five additional gates,” United said in a statement. “American has been aware of our agreement for over a year and has worked to block the implementation at every opportunity.” \n \nO’Hare is the world’s second-busiest airport in terms of take-offs and landings after Atlanta’s Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport, according to an Airports Council International 2016 ranking. \n \nAmerican Airlines carriers accounted for 35.5 percent of passengers at O’Hare in 2016, versus 44.5 percent for United carriers, according to city data. \n \nThe eight-year expansion plan calls for replacing one of O’Hare’s existing terminals with a new global terminal, where United and American would be relocated. Other terminals would be renovated to expand gate capacity. Construction is scheduled to begin next year. Emanuel said the expansion provides a level playing field for competition and that “multiple airlines” are on board with the plan, which he added is moving forward. \n \n“The key thing for us as a city is to make sure we can compete and we’re not dependent on any one airline or how O’Hare was structured in the past to compete,” he told reporters. \n \nThe plan marks the biggest terminal expansion in O’Hare’s history, which dates back to the mid-1940s. \n \nIt relies on a new use and lease agreement with airlines that the mayor introduced to the Chicago City Council on Wednesday, along with a proposal to sell up to $4 billion of airport revenue bonds to start financing the project. The new lease would replace an existing 35-year deal that expires in May. \n \nChicago Chief Financial Officer Carole Brown said the bonds would be paid off with revenue generated by airlines, parking and concessions at O’Hare, as well as federally authorized passenger facility charges. She added that the timing for an initial bond sale would be the last quarter of 2018 at the earliest. \n \nTags: Airports Council International , American Airlines , American Airlines Group , , Jackson International Airport , Mayor Rahm Emanuel , O’Hare International Airport , United Airlines Inc. \n  Related Posts"}

{"articleID":33556910699,"title":"Bloomberg Poll: Trump Tariffs to Stoke Inflation, Dent GDP and Jobs","content":"Trade wars are bad but President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs won’t have much direct impact on the U.S. economy unless the situation escalates, according to a new survey conducted by Bloomberg News. \n \nRoughly two-thirds of the 35 economists polled by Bloomberg expect the tariffs that Trump signed last week would cause a small decrease in jobs and a small drop in U.S. economic growth, which is enjoying its third-longest expansion on record. One economist predicted a small gain in jobs. \n \nNo one thought there would be a large impact in either direction. \n \n“By themselves, the tariffs on steel and aluminum will likely have a modest impact on growth and inflation,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida. \n \n“The bigger concerns are retaliatory tariffs against U.S. exports, the possibility of a broader trade war, higher costs, and greater uncertainty for global business investment.” \n \nTrump on March 8 slapped tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but immediately excluded Canada and Mexico -- so long as they reach a new North American Free Trade agreement that passes muster -- and said other nations could petition for an exclusion. That’s set off a race for U.S. allies to plead for special treatment, while China has warned of “strong” measures to protect its interests. \n \nMorgan Stanley estimated the impact of the tariffs as no more than 0.3 percentage point of U.S. gross domestic product, writing in a report that they were “unlikely to derail the global macro outlook.” Barclays Plc has estimated as much as a 0.2 percentage point impact. \n \nTrump has also tweeted a trade war is easily winnable. Most economists see losses to all sides. \n \n‘Genuinely Stupid’ \n \n“These tariffs are a really bad idea,” said James Smith, chief economist at Parsec Financial Management Inc. in Asheville, North Carolina. “It will cost consumers millions of dollars for each job saved in aluminum or steel production -- a genuinely stupid and counterproductive policy.” \n \nWhen President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about 200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate. \n \nEighty percent of the economists predicted a small increase in inflation from the trade policy, while the remainder saw no effect. \n \nWhile there will be initially “higher import prices and substitution toward higher domestic prices,” that will be followed by disinflationary effects when tariffs diminish demand, said Derek Holt, an economist at Scotiabank in Toronto. \n \nMore problematic than the U.S. tariffs is the likelihood that other countries will respond in kind. The European Union has threatened targeted retaliation on iconic U.S. brands, including Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles, Levi Strauss & Co. jeans and bourbon whiskey, if the bloc fails to win an exemption. \n \n“We expect the impact on U.S. growth and inflation to be fairly limited,” said Mikael Olai Milhoj, a senior analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. “There is a risk that we are too optimistic and that there will be a bigger trade war, which would be negative for the global economy.” \n \nA full-blown trade war could cost the global economy $470 billion, an analysis by Bloomberg Economics found. The profession generally views trade as helpful to both partners and the history or tit-for-tat trade tariffs as a good reason to avoid making the same mistake again. \n  \nWhat Our Economists Say \nWhat happens to global growth if there’s a trade war? Based on Bloomberg Economics’ estimates, if the U.S. raises import costs by 10% and the rest of the world retaliates, raising tariffs on U.S. exports, the cost by 2020 would be 0.5% of global GDP. To put that into perspective, that’s about $470 billion -- roughly the size of Thailand’s output. \n-- Jamie Murray and Tom Orlik, Bloomberg Economics \n \nThe Smoot-Hawley Act, which raised U.S. tariffs on thousands of imported goods when it was passed by Congress in 1930, is often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. Yet most trade spats end up without that kind of damage, and most in the survey were hopeful. \n \nThe U.S. economy, boosted by a $1.5 trillion tax cut that Trump signed last year, is on a solid footing and the unemployment rate of 4.1 percent is the lowest since 2000. \n \n“The negative impact of the tariffs -- which are a tax hike on consumers and users of steel and aluminum -- is more than offset by the benefits of the more sweeping tax reform,” said Brian Wesbury at First Trust Advisors in Wheaton, Illinois. “So, the economy is set to accelerate and no one will be able to tell how much more it could have grown without the tariffs.”"}
{"articleID":33670611847,"title":"Optiv Security Earns Frost & Sullivan 2018 Competitive Strategy Innovation and Leadership Award","content":"DENVER--(Business Wire)-- Optiv Security , a leading security solutions integrator, today announced it has earned Frost & Sullivan’s 2018 Competitive Strategy Innovation and Leadership Award in the North American managed and professional security services market. \nIn a recently published research report about Optiv’s award, Frost & Sullivan states, “As companies are faced with choice on who to partner with in their cyber security journeys, they are justified in asking the variety of providers knocking on their doors, ‘what is your cyber security pedigree, are you committed to cyber security and do your past and planned investments reflect unwavering commitment?’ Optiv has the proof points to stamp those questions with an unequivocal affirmative.” \n \n“The practice of cyber security is challenging and no company is immune from these challenges,” said Michael Suby, Stratecast vice president of research at Frost & Sullivan. “As more security technologies are added, the administrative complexity grows, leading to sub optimized cyber security practices, and protection gaps for attackers to exploit. In addition, as the cost of in-house cyber security continues to rise, personnel churn undermines the ongoing quest to establish, adapt, and maintain best practice operations. And finally, a distributed and dynamic attack surface is placing organizations at greater risk unless their cyber security practices can expand and adapt in equal measure. A trusted partner has become essential, and Optiv’s experience, capabilities and singular focus on cyber security have enabled the company to fill this crucial role.” \n \n“Historically, organizations have taken an ‘outside-in’ approach to cyber security that focuses first on identifying specific threats and then reacting with procurement. The result has been less than optimal for many enterprises, creating wildly expensive and complex security technology infrastructures that are impossible to manage, measure and maintain,” said Peter Evans, Optiv’s chief marketing officer. “Optiv’s ‘inside-out’ approach starts with an organization’s unique business priorities and needs first – building out from there with cyber security strategy, infrastructure, rationalization, operations optimization and ongoing measurement – rather than continuing to run on a never-ending treadmill, a continuous “reaction” approach to every new threat and compliance mandate as it emerges or evolves. We are proud to receive this award from Frost & Sullivan, and believe it underscores our philosophy that everything we do – from our product portfolio and advisory services, to our customer service and partner relationships – brings clarity to the current state of cyber security chaos.” \n \nOptiv’s Best Practice recognition was a result of its strong performance against the following criteria: \n Competitive Differentiation – Unlike a vast number of managed and professional services companies that make cyber security services one element of their business, Optiv is focused solely on providing solutions that make enterprise security radically stronger, simpler, less costly and more accountable. The company offers a comprehensive technology and services portfolio, and breadth of experience and expertise that spans across all stages of the security program lifecycle. All activities are driven by data analytics, data intelligence and actionable insights to further optimize and rationalize security operations and performance to lower costs and improve efficacy.  Strategic Execution – Optiv transforms security from a roadblock to a business enabler through one of the broadest portfolios of service offerings in the industry, including professional security services, managed security services and other solutions that address a variety of pressing client issues, such as cloud security, advanced threats, the internet of things (IoT) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), among others.  Strategy Effectiveness – While Optiv has a broad portfolio of service offerings, Frost & Sullivan recognizes the company’s aggressiveness in identifying areas of distinction, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) and cyber threat intelligence-as-a-service, and then building on these offers to deepen alignment with clients’ evolving needs.  Partner Engagement Experience – The more partners a client has in supporting its cyber security endeavors further complicates a likely client scenario of technology and vendor sprawl in deployed security platforms and appliances. Optiv’s lengthy tenure in delivering security services to clients of varied backgrounds, its deep technical expertise, and its broad managed and professional security services portfolio present potential and existing clients the means to consolidate and simplify their partner engagements.  Customer Service Experience – Optiv believes in fostering a close physical presence to its client base to support the business relationship, which directly contributes to the company’s ability to demonstrate first-hand technical expertise and customer service passion. In addition, the company employs a number of former CISOs who bring to client engagements real-world and pragmatic experience that drives more successful security programs.  Brand Equity – Optiv has established a strong brand presence and the company’s investments in offerings, capabilities and geographic expansion are clear indicators that the company is intent on growing rapidly and further solidifying its global brand.  \nResearch Methodology \nFrost & Sullivan's industry analyst team benchmarks market participants and measures their performance through independent, primary interviews and secondary industry research to evaluate and identify best practices.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - paid bonuses worth 2.3 billion euros ($2.83 billion) for 2017, four times higher than the previous year even as the German lender warned on costs for 2018 and reported a bigger 2017 loss than previously disclosed. Germany's flagship lender said on Friday that its top 12 managers would forego payouts for 2017 after the bank said it lost 735 million euros, the third annual loss in a row and more than the 497 million euros it had reported in February.\n\nThe bank, which distributed 546 million euros in bonuses in 2016, also said its cost-cutting plans were hitting roadblocks, partly because of a delay in disposals. \n\nIn addition, the lender said it expected higher costs related to Britain's exit from the an Union - which is expected to lead to hundreds of the bank's staff moving from London - and a postponement in savings from the merger of its in-house retail bank with Postbank.\n\nThe bank's decision to push ahead with paying big bonuses, despite heavy losses, has tested relations with German politicians and the public, many of whom deeply disapprove of high pay and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism.\n\nChief Executive John Cryan, who has called for patience in his effort to turn around the bank, defended the bonus payments as an effort to retain staff. \n\n\"If we want to live up to our claim of being the leading an bank with a global network, we have to invest in our employees so that we can continue to provide the best solutions for our clients,\" he said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nDeutsche sharply cut bonuses for 2016 following speculation that it would need a state bailout to stay afloat.\n\nSince then, the bank has executed an overhaul that includes the merger of its in-house retail bank with Postbank and the partial IPO of its asset management unit, which is expected to start trading next week. \n\nIn its annual report, the bank said adjusted costs in 2018 were now expected to be 23 billion euros, up from its original forecast for 22 billion, and that some cost savings wouldn't kick in until 2019.\n\nThe bank was cautiously optimistic for this year, saying it expects revenues to rise in 2018 after declining 12 percent in 2017. \"We remain committed to our objective of delivering a net profit and a competitive dividend payout for 2018,\" Cryan said.\n\nDuring his tenure, Cryan has stabilized the bank, raised capital, designed an overhaul, cut some costs, confronted daunting legal challenges, and managed the demands of greater regulation.\n\nBut the 2017 loss has prompted some investors to question whether Cryan should be given more time to turn around the bank, after less than three years as chief executive.\n\nInvestors are also frustrated by paltry dividends, which the bank said would be 11 cents for 2017, resulting in a payout for investors of 230 million euros.\n\n\"The stark mismatch between bonuses and dividends must be remedied in the next few years,\" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, which holds Deutsche stock. Shares in were 0.2 percent higher at 1121 GMT, up less than the broader DAX index of major German companies as investors ignored news of the bigger loss.\n\n($1 = 0.8115 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Tom Sims; Additional reporting by Andreas Framke; Editing by Maria Sheahan, Edmund Blair and Adrian Croft)\n\nBy Tom Sims"}

At peak production, the unit will produce 1.5 million metric tons per year (m.t./yr). This unit will be one of the largest and most energy-efficient crackers in the world.  In September 2017, the company announced the successful commissioning and start-up of two new Marlex polyethylene units in Old Ocean, Texas, based on the company’s proprietary MarTech technologies.  Together, these assets form the bulk of the company’s U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project (USGCPP), which was first announced in 2011. \n \n“Construction of these world-scale assets has been ongoing since 2014 and today, we are entering a new era of growth,” said Mark Lashier, president and CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical.  “With global demand for ethylene and polyethylene poised for sustained long-term growth, the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project will allow Chevron Phillips Chemical to deliver high-quality products to our customers across the country and around the globe.” \n \nEthylene produced by the new ethane cracker at Cedar Bayou will be used to meet the needs of the company’s derivative units, including the two new polyethylene units at Old Ocean, Texas, which are capable of producing a wide variety of products, ranging from metallocene linear low-density polyethylene to Advanced Dual Loop bimodal polyethylene resins.  These resins are turned into consumer and industrial products such as plastic films for food safety and preservation; and polyethylene pipe for water distribution and natural gas transport.  In addition, the ethylene will feed the company’s AlphaPlus normal alpha olefins plants which are used extensively for polyethylene comonomers, plasticizers, synthetic motor oils, lubricants, automotive additives, surfactants, paper sizing, and in a wide range of other specialty applications. \n \n“Born from the shale revolution that is providing low-cost feedstock, the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project is the most transformational project in the history of our company,” continued Lashier.  “Our company and our growing employee base, the communities we call home, and the entire Gulf Coast region’s economy will benefit for decades to come as our project comes to life.”"}

{"articleID":33438607607,"title":"Commercial Tire Market Strong According to Yokohama Tire VP","content":"|  March 1, 2018   Dan Funkhouser, Yokohama Tire’s recently promoted VP of commercial sales, is bullish on the commercial tire market. In this Q&A, he looks at what’s contributing to its growth…and what could slow it down.  \nQuestion: What are your takeaways from 2017 for the commercial tire market and Yokohama Tire? \n \nDan Funkhouser: The commercial tire market is very strong and in growth mode. Both the replacement and OEM tire markets are expanding. This fits in perfectly with Yokohama’s new manufacturing plant in West Point, Mississippi, which will increase our capabilities to service both our OEM and replacement business partners as they grow.  OEM orders increased near the end of last year and that trend has continued. We feel that replacement and OE segments are going to be very strong in 2018. \n \nQuestion: What’s making the commercial tire market so strong? \n \nFunkhouser: The manufacturing sector is experiencing unusually robust expansion. Housing starts are at a 10-year high. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will lead to a reinvestment in manufacturing and capacity. Manufacturing is strong and the economy continues to grow at a solid pace. People are spending money and consumer confidence has increased. \n \nQuestion: Industry-wise, what will drive the market in 2018? Any new trends to watch? \n \nFunkhouser: The manufacturing sector is going to continue its potent run. Shipping capacity remains very tight, hovering close to 100 percent. That’s going to force the industry to respond with new equipment purchases, which in turn is going to put more pressure on the issue of driver and driver retention. This will mean the driver shortage will remain an issue. All of this has led to freight rates that are exceeding a five-year high over the quarter and will continue to remain high. All freight segments year-over-year are up, dry van freight is up 54 percent, refrigerated freight is up 112 percent, flatbed freight is up 63 percent and specialty freight is up 45 percent. \n \nAs the price of gas and diesel continue to rise, oil and gas production will increase in the U.S. Servicing these customers require the type of tire with chip and cut-resistant tread compounds with durable casing that are retreadable. Yokohama has always been a leader in the on/off road segment and our casing has a reputation in the market as one of the most retreadable in the industry. \n \nThe new greenhouse gas regulations are starting to have an effect on the marketplace. Tire manufacturing planning teams are designing products that will meet or exceed the new standards that will be in effect soon. For example, the new Yokohama R&D facility in Charlotte, North Carolina will design tires for the U.S. market that will be built by our plant in Mississippi. These tires will be designed and manufactured to meet and exceed those new regulations. \n \nQuestion: What sectors will present the best opportunities? \n \nFunkhouser: The entire transportation market is growing. As manufacturing continues to grow the need to ship, the components and finished products will rise. Construction is going to increase and the infrastructure bill will add many construction and road jobs. As the price of gas and oil continue to rise, servicing the oil and natural gas fields will increase. This will cause an increase in mixed service tire demand and retreading. \n \nQuestion: What do you see that could impact the market negatively in 2018? \n \nFunkhouser: The increase in the price of fuel. As fuel prices increase, freight costs will go up. I also think the infrastructure – its costs and the highway jobs – are going to cause an increase in traffic jams and could delay some shipments across the country. These delays could also have an effect a driver’s hours of service. \n \nThe driver shortage is an issue. Fleets are already operating at capacity close to 100 percent. There just are not enough drivers to service the increase of freight demand in the marketplace. This issue will continue to impact and limit growth in the commercial trucking market. \n \nQuestion: What’s new for Yokohama in 2018? \n \nFunkhouser: We recently launched the SmartWay ® -verified TY577 MC 2™ , which is a fuel-efficient, long-haul drive tire that’s 30/32-inches deep. It’s available in sizes 295/75R22.5, 11R22.5, 285/75R24.5 and 11R24.5, in 14- and 16-ply ratings. The TY577 MC 2 will be at our booth (#2821) at the TMC show. \n \nWe’ve also just introduced two new trailer tires that will also be at TMC: the BluEarth ® 109L and BluEarth ® 109L ultra wide base (UWB). The 109L UWB, our most fuel-efficient trailer tire, is designed for long-haul and line-hall applications, will be offered in size 445/50R22.5 and comes with a six-year unlimited mileage/three retread warranty. \n \nThe long-haul 109L, which is manufactured at our Mississippi plant in West Point, Mississippi, will come in sizes 295/75R22.5, 11R22.5, 285/75R24.5 and 11R24.5. It has the lowest rolling resistance in the category. \n \nQuestion: What are fleet’s biggest concerns when it comes to tires? \n \nFunkhouser: The total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the tire. This includes things like the original tread life/mileage, the fuel saving of a low-rolling resistant tire, being available when and where the fleets need them, and the retreadability of the casing. \n \nQuestion: What do you hear from fleets about the influx of cheaper tires that are coming into the market? Are they still looking for good quality tires or are some going for price? \n \nFunkhouser: There will always be those that will just buy a tire on price, and truthfully, some of those tires coming in are getting better. However, fleet managers still look at the total cost of ownership. This includes national account programs, the emergency road service coverage, the total availability of the tire across the market and, a quality casing. Fleet managers may also limit the number of brands they run in their fleet. \n \nI think they tend to stay with the manufacturers that offer the lowest cost of ownership in total. \n \nQuestion: You’ve got a shortage of drivers on one hand and self-driving trucks on the horizon. Any idea how it’s going to play out in the industry? \n \nFunkhouser: One thing we do know for sure is self-driving trucks will still require tires, and we will continue to make tires for those vehicles. Right now, the technology is all so new that we don’t know. It will be some time until we see self-driving cars and trucks on the road in mass, but the technology exists. I am sure someday it is going to happen, but at the end of the day, it will take an extremely professional and qualified driver to deliver the product to the ultimate end-user. \n   \nCategory : General Update , News , Wheels & Tires"}

While Grimes found a moment to enjoy the salmon pink swing whose chains resemble those of an actual Chanel bag, Diamandis lounged in a clawfoot tub filled with small pearls. \n \nSome of their musical cohorts attended the party in more quintessentially Chanel garments—the Haim sisters each rocked a different take on the house’s signature tweed, and Kilo Kish also lounged in the tub in a structured blue suit dress that she paired with translucent boots.

Odinius, Managing Director Dataforce GmbH. An exciting panel discussion and opportunities for informal networking rounded off the event. \n \nThe two co-organizers, fleetcompetenceeurope GmbH and the Swiss fleet magazine aboutFLEET, were able to offer the international fleet industry in Geneva a unique, English-speaking platform. \n \nIn his presentation, Michael Müller, Senior Director Head of Mobility & Facilities, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, introduced the new mobility concept of Daiichi Sankyo. With this concept, the pharmaceutical company is breaking new ground: for example, employees receive a so-called mobility budget. Employees are free to choose the mobility budget or, alternatively, to continue driving a company car. Meanwhile, about 25 percent of Daiichi Sankyo employees are not using company vehicles. \n \nThen, Marc A. Odinius (photo), Managing Director of Dataforce GmbH, gave an exciting insight into the tendencies of the European fleet market. He said that alternatively-powered company vehicles are on the upswing, while diesel will continue to lose market share in the future. However, this does not alter the fact that in addition to the propulsion systems, mobility behaviour (e.g. utilisation of vehicles) is facing fundamental changes in order to ensure mobility in future. \n \nThe subsequent panel discussion moderated by Thilo von Ulmenstein, Managing Partner of fleetcompetence europe GmbH, was joined by Hervé Girardot, Head of Arval Consulting & Corporate Vehicle Observatory, as well as Stuart Donnelly, Senior Director – Group International Sales Northern Europe & USA at Sixt.

The facility is part of a $225 million commitment that Highmark and AHN have made to establish a new paradigm in community-based cancer care. \n \n“The demand for expert cancer care is growing in our region, and so are the number of innovative treatment options available to patients today, from targeted therapies that zero in on tumors’ genetic profiles to new technologies that can eliminate the need for surgery,” said David Holmberg, President and CEO, Highmark Health. “Our significant investment in the AHN Cancer Institute will not only greatly enhance our patients’ and members’ access to care, but also transform it through the extraordinary work of our caregivers and the advanced capabilities of the facilities we are developing.” \n \nAHN currently employs more than 200 cancer physicians and 500 oncology professionals who provide care at more than 50 affiliated cancer clinics across western Pennsylvania. In addition to the new Academic Center, the network is building multiple community cancer centers that will provide comprehensive services close-to-home for patients and their families. Locations already identified for the new facilities include Monroeville, Erie, Butler and Beaver County.     \n \nThe network will be recruiting more than 200 additional oncology professionals over the next two years to staff the academic and community centers, including physicians and other specialists. \n \nAccording to the American Cancer Society, approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases – including 81,000 in Pennsylvania alone - are expected to be diagnosed in 2018, a two percent hike from 2015. Notably, approximately eighty percent of those diagnosed with cancer in Pennsylvania live outside the large population centers of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The number of cancer survivors in the U.S. is expected to rise to from 15.5 million to 20.3 million in 2026. \n \n“At AHN, we are committed to helping patients and their families fight cancer on every front,” said Cynthia Hundorfean, President and CEO of AHN. “From collaborating with the best minds in cancer care to pioneer the treatments and cures of tomorrow, to investing in resources that improve the experience and outcomes of our patients today, to transitioning more cancer care into the communities where patients live, our focus is keeping patients at the center of everything we do.” \n \nAs the hub of the AHN Cancer Institute’s clinical trials coordination, the Academic Center will be a critical resource for the Network’s expanding collaborations with the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Medicine Kimmel Cancer Center, including studies of novel immunotherapy regimens, genomic testing, targeted biologic therapies, and other promising new treatments. Two trials currently being offered exclusively in Pittsburgh at the Institute include a study looking at the immunotherapy Nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of esophageal cancer , and another that examines a new strategy that has shown preliminary positive results for men with treatment-resistant metastatic prostate cancer, alternately flooding and starving the body of testosterone. \n \nIn total, AHN and Johns Hopkins together offer cancer patients access to novel therapies being explored in more than 600 active clinical trials between the organizations. \n \n“With this new facility at AGH, we are establishing the academic core of a cancer care model that allows the vast majority of patients to be treated at the highest level in their own communities,” said David Parda, MD, Chair of the AHN Cancer Institute. “At our Academic Center, we will continue to care for the most complex cases, while also helping to advance our knowledge of this disease, develop new standards of care through research and clinical trials, and train the next generation of physicians and other cancer specialists.” \n \nThe Academic Center will provide a wide-array of clinical and support services for cancer patients, including, state-of-the-art radiation oncology capabilities; 49 chemotherapy infusion bays; conference and exam rooms with telemedicine capabilities to facilitate peer review and clinical collaboration, tumor boards, collaborative research projects and clinical trials development; a positive image salon; social services; nutritional counseling and financial counseling. \n \nThe new facility will house the most advanced cancer fighting technologies available, including one of the nation’s first Gamma Pod systems - a groundbreaking technology that quickly eradicates breast tumors with high precision radiation; Gamma Knife therapy for the non-invasive stereotactic treatment of brain tumors and other complex neurological conditions; and the latest in intensity modulated and image guided radiation therapy for all solid tumors, including one of the first five, state-of-the-art MRI linear accelerator capabilities in the United States. \n \nLocated adjacent to the AGH Imaging Center, the Academic Center will provide cancer patients with access to all the advanced modalities that they may need during the course of screening, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship. Close connections with imaging, surgery, pathology and other medical specialties at AGH will help patients at the center navigate all aspects of cancer care with greater efficiency and effectiveness.     \n \nThe Academic Center will be a four-story structure, with two floors below ground and two above, located on East North Avenue and situated between the hospital’s South Tower and Sandusky Street parking garage. The façade of the structure will feature blue faceted glass with an atrium that preserves the South Tower’s historical features and connects to the hospital’s Magovern Conference Center and front rotunda entrance, providing easy access for cancer patients and families, medical professionals and the community. \n \nLike the new community cancer centers being developed by AHN, the network’s patient-centered philosophy is also reflected in the design and aesthetics of the Academic Center. The facility will feature comfortable waiting areas, exam rooms and treatment areas that maximize privacy, abundant natural light and soft colors. Valet parking will be provided and patients will be greeted by navigators who will help manage their visit and expedite their care. \n \n“Our facility will be designed to help patients and their families be comfortable, informed and empowered in the face of cancer, so that they can maximize their health and well-being and achieve the best possible outcomes,” Dr. Parda said.     \n### \n \nAbout Allegheny Health Network \nAllegheny Health Network, a Highmark Health Company, is a western Pennsylvania-based integrated healthcare system that serves patients from across a five state region that includes Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

In 2012, the US quietly closed a two-year probe against Monsanto for being a monopoly — and the staff was not happy about the decision, sources said. \n“Bayer was a little surprised” the deal signed in September 2016 did not get cleared last week, the source close to the situation said. \n \nAlready, Bayer has an agreement to sell the combined company’s vegetable seeds and selected crop science businesses to BASF. \n \nSeparately on Wednesday, the European Commission approved the Bayer-Monsanto merger. \n \nThe gap between the feds and Bayer is relatively small, with law enforcement requesting that Bayer divest the digital agriculture businesses — a sacrifice that Bayer is reluctant to make, a source following the situation said. \n \nWith the US set to begin a trial this week against AT&T and its megamerger with Time Warner , some insiders say it would be an opportune time for Bayer to force a distracted antitrust team into a difficult decision by “certifying compliance” on the merger — a move that would force a thumb’s up, or down, decision in 30 days. \n \nBut, “Bayer is not playing brinkmanship yet,” the source close to the situation said. \n \nWhat’s more, President Trump’s unpredictable view on mergers is making Bayer a bit cautious, sources said. \n \nThere is about a 50 percent chance the US clears the merger within the next several months on Bayer’s proposed terms, the source close to the situation said. \n \nThe Justice Department said Wednesday that it continued “to examine the effects of the proposed transaction on American farmers and consumers.” \n \nA Bayer spokesman said it continued to work with the US with the goal of closing the transaction during the second quarter.

{"articleID":33437358686,"title":"Economy: Athens’ Upside","content":"By Jeffrey Humphreys \n  \nThe 2018 economic outlook for Athens is good. Its economic structure tilts toward higher education and healthcare, and these major industries will do well. \n \nAthens’ economy does not depend heavily on inherently cyclical industries such as manufacturing, construction, or transportation and logistics. It also is not very dependent on exports and therefore is not overly vulnerable to either foreign competition or trade shocks. \n \nConsequently, Athens’ economy tends not to overheat during the good times and not to tank during the bad times. Its structure makes the area a very comfortable place to live, work and do business. \n \nCuts in the state’s appropriations for higher education typically lag the business cycle, which helps to even out economic activity in Athens over the course of all but the most exaggerated business cycles. The upshot is economic stability for the area. \n \nLooking forward, employment will increase by 1.5 percent this year – about 1,400 jobs. Due to increasing revenue collections, state appropriations for higher education will increase slightly in FY 2019, which bodes well for University of Georgia’s (UGA) and in turn Athens’ short-term economic prospects. \n \nAthens will also benefit from area-specific factors: Voxpro will create more than 500 technical support jobs at a new high-tech call center. Zaxby’s plans to build a large corporate campus in neighboring Oconee County to support the growth of its franchise business. Over the next 10 to 15 years, the fast-food chain expects to create hundreds of jobs at the site. And Caterpillar, manufacturer of construction and mining equipment and diesel and gas engines that opened a facility in the area in 2013, will continue to support the local economy. \n \nThe outlook for healthcare services is excellent. Piedmont Healthcare’s acquisition of Athens Regional Medical Center (ARMC) improves the latter’s balance sheet, thereby enhancing prospects for expansion. Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center, as ARMC is now called, has six nationally ranked specialties, the highest number earned by any Georgia hospital outside Atlanta or Savannah. In addition, St. Mary’s hospital was recently designated Georgia’s large hospital of the year. Athens will benefit from its role as the regional medical service center for northeast Georgia. \n \nThe establishment of a medical school at UGA in partnership with Augusta University will help Athens’ healthcare providers expand into rural and exurban areas where the population skews older. The Augusta University/University of Georgia Medical Partnership will encourage further development of clinical healthcare and biomedicine. \n \nThe establishment of UGA’s College of Engineering in 2012 contributes directly to the region’s growth through its operating budget, its personnel budget and student spending. It also enhances entrepreneurial development and helps Athens recruit high-tech companies and venture capital, boosting the region’s economic development aims. Similarly, Athens’ potential for high-tech development is enhanced by UGA’s Computer Science Program, which is one of the fastest-growing majors on campus. Athens Technical College also has very strong technology programs. \n \nThe region will benefit from recent and planned activities by many of its existing employers. High-tech employment is expanding, and a cluster of biotechnology industries with links to UGA is gradually developing critical mass, boosting prospects for additional growth of the life-sciences employment in Athens. \n \nThe new Hyatt Place hotel attached to The Classic Center should attract more high-end business meetings and special events. More exhibit space at The Classic Center helps Athens attract larger conventions and trade shows. \n \nUpgrades to UGA’s Georgia Center for Continuing Education and Hotel will make it a more attractive place to host academic meetings and conferences. The growth of the hospitality industry also reflects Athens’ successful development as a regional entertainment center, especially with its music and dining scene, college sports, downtown shopping, and many cultural events and attractions. \n \nHomebuilders’ prospects look good. Since early 2013, home prices have been on the upswing – at the end of 2017, the area’s home prices surpassed their pre-Great Recession level by 7 percent. Of course, cumulative inflation over that same period was 22 percent. Therefore, home prices are not actually that high. \n \nWhat is the bottom line for Athens? With top-notch higher education and healthcare along with new and expanding businesses, the immediate prospects are very good."}

The Pyeongchang Olympics experienced a cyberattack that temporarily paralyzed IT systems ahead of the official opening ceremony, shutting down display monitors, killing Wi-Fi, and taking down the Olympics website so that visitors were unable to print tickets. Kaspersky Lab has also found that several ski resort facilities in South Korea suffered from this worm, which disabled the operation of ski gates and ski lifts at the resorts. Although the actual impact of attacks with this malware was limited, it clearly contained the capability to be devastating, which luckily didn’t happen. \n \nNevertheless, the real interest of the cybersecurity industry lay not in the potential or even actual damage caused by the Destroyer’s attacks, but in the origin of the malware. Perhaps no other sophisticated malware has had so many attribution hypotheses put forward as the OlympicDestroyer. Within days of its discovery, research teams from all over the world had between them managed to attribute this malware to Russia, China and North Korea, based on a number of features previously attributed to cyber-espionage and sabotage actors allegedly based in these countries or working for these countries’ governments. \n \nKaspersky Lab researchers were also trying to understand which hacking group was behind this malware. At some point during their research, they came across something that looked like 100% evidence connecting the malware to Lazarus – an infamous nation state backed group linked to North Korea. \n \nThis conclusion was based on a unique trace left by the attackers. A combination of certain features of the code development environment stored in the files can be used as a ‘fingerprint’, in some cases identifying the malware authors and their projects. In the sample analyzed by Kaspersky Lab, this fingerprint gave a 100% match with previously known Lazarus malware components and zero overlap with any other clean or malicious file known to date to Kaspersky Lab. Combined with other similarities in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), it drew researchers to the preliminary conclusion that OlympicDestroyer was yet another Lazarus operation. However, the motives and other inconsistencies with Lazarus TTPs uncovered during the investigation by Kaspersky Lab onsite at the compromised facility in South Korea made researchers revisit the rare artefact. \n \nFollowing another careful look at the evidence and manual verification of each feature, researchers discovered that the set of features didn’t match the code – it had been forged to perfectly match the fingerprint used by Lazarus. \n \nAs a result, the researchers concluded that the features’ ‘fingerprint’ is a very sophisticated false flag, intentionally placed inside the malware in order to give threat hunters the impression that they had found ‘smoking gun’ evidence, knocking them of the trail to more accurate attribution. \n \n“To our knowledge, the evidence we were able to find was not previously used for attribution. Yet the attackers decided to use it, predicting that someone would find it. They counted on the fact that forgery of this artefact is very hard to prove. It’s as if a criminal had stolen someone else’ DNA and left it at a crime scene instead of their own. We discovered and proved that the DNA found on the crime scene was dropped there on purpose. All this demonstrates how much effort attackers are ready to spend in order to stay unidentified for as long as possible. We’ve always said that attribution in cyberspace is very hard as lots of things can be faked, and OlympicDestroyer is a pretty precise illustration of this,” - said Vitaly Kamluk, Head of APAC Research Team, Kaspersky Lab. \n \n“Another takeaway from this story for us is that attribution is has to be taken extremely seriously. Given how politicized cyberspace has recently become, the wrong attribution could lead to severe consequences and actors may start trying to manipulate the opinion of the security community in order to influence the geopolitical agenda,” - he added. \n \nThe accurate attribution of OlympicDestroyer is still an open question – simply because it is a unique example of the implementation of very sophisticated false flags. However, Kaspersky Lab researchers found that the attackers used privacy-protecting service NordVPN and a hosting provider called MonoVM, which both accept Bitcoins. These and some other discovered TTPs were previously seen to be used by Sofacy – the Russian-speaking actor. \n \nKaspersky Lab products successfully detect and block the OlympicDestroyer malware. \n \nRead more about how Kaspersky Lab researchers investigated the OlympicDestroyer attacks in South Korea and Europe in the blogpost on Securelist.com ."}

{"articleID":33760258092,"title":"","content":"WASHINGTON, DC – With the inclusion of key provisions related to America’s tipped workers included in the recently passed Consolidated Appropriations Act, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has issued a Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) to address WHD’s enforcement of tip credit rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). \n \nAs a result of this legislation, workplaces may establish tip pooling arrangements between “front of the house” and “back of the house” staff, such as cooks and dishwashers. The bill vacated WHD’s 2011 regulations that barred tip pooling when employers pay tipped employees at least the full federal minimum wage. \n \nAdditionally, Congress gave the Department—for the first time—authority to prevent employers from taking employees’ tips in all circumstances. Congress enacted this bipartisan law in response to U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta’s testimony last month before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Related Agencies that he would support a law barring employers from taking tips. \n \nFAB 2018-3 confirms that employers who pay the full federal minimum wage may now allow non-traditionally tipped workers, such as cooks and dishwashers, to participate in tip pools. The FAB also confirms that WHD will immediately begin using its new enforcement tools to protect American workers’ tips—including by recovering all tips unlawfully kept by employers, and imposing liquidated damages and civil monetary penalties as appropriate. \n \nFor more information about the  FLSA  and other laws enforced by the Division, contact its toll-free helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243).

{"articleID":33591949955,"title":"Safety Of Hanford Steel Questioned By Department Of Energy","content":"The U.S. Department of Energy is demanding thousands of pages of documentation from one of its top contractors at Hanford. They want to know exactly what grade of steel is being used in a massive radioactive waste treatment plant at the decommissioned nuclear site.  \n \nFor more than a decade, Bechtel has been building this massive waste treatment plant. The buildings look like an urban block in the middle of the desert sand. It’s supposed to take 56 million gallons of radioactive waste and turn it into more stable glass logs.   \n \nNow, Bechtel’s digging into its records to prove the structural steel already built into that massive factory is up to the task. \n \nThe Department of Energy penned a letter earlier this month. In it, a top manager said the DOE is concerned that these documents from Bechtel haven’t been provided or are incomplete. And the letter said this problem has been going on for a while. \n \nThe letter referenced reports from 2013 and from late last year. Critics are concerned that the problem persists despite the fact that parts of the plant’s construction are nearing completion. \n \nThe letter stated that the importance of ultra-strong steel is high. The structure not only has to withstand treating radioactive and chemical wastes but also has to hold up under any accident and keep hazardous wastes contained. \n \nBechtel said it has almost all of the documents already in hand and that there has never been any question of the quality of its steel. \n \nBechtel has 30 days to get most of its documentation to DOE — the clock started on March 6. DOE officials say they will determine if the contractor’s documentation is enough after it receives the stack. \n \nBechtel’s statement: \n \n“The need to confirm receipt of appropriate documentation had been previously identified by Bechtel and was being actively worked. We have documentation that demonstrates the nuclear-grade structural steel meets project requirements. We are completing our review of the documentation for a few remaining commercial-grade steel items. \n \nWe accelerated this process using our records management systems to finalize the activity. We met with the DOE Office of River Protection on Wednesday morning and notified them we have identified and addressed the paperwork mentioned in the letter. \n \nThe safety and quality of the structural steel was never in question.” \n \nU.S. Department of Energy’s statement: \n \n“DOE is committed to the safety of the workers, public and the environment. One very important aspect of that commitment is strong oversight of the construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) at the Hanford Site.  The Department recently identified that the quality assurance records needed to demonstrate the pedigree of the safety significant structural steel used in WTP facilities were not adequate. The Department directed Bechtel National Inc. to gather the necessary documentation and provide it to the Department. When received, DOE will determine whether the documentation meets applicable quality assurance standards for the steel being used in the WTP facilities. The Department takes its oversight and mission execution responsibility seriously, and will continue to provide strong, safety-focused oversight of the WTP project.” \n \nTom Carpenter, executive director of Hanford Challenge’s statement: \n \n“This could be a showstopper. We applaud new DOE leadership for finally holding the contractor’s feet to the fire on this critical issue of quality assurance, but I’m more interested in what happens next. For DOE to fix this, it must enforce a rigorous nuclear safety culture and put a new contractor in place that takes nuclear quality assurance seriously. \n \nAs early as 2010, internal experts blew the whistle on this exact issue. The response was to fire their own experts, including the Manager of Research and Technology, Dr. Walter Tamosaitis, and Manager of Environmental and Nuclear Safety Donna Busche. \n \nAs a result of the contractors’ actions, this extremely crucial multi-billion dollar facility is at serious risk of being scrapped. \n \nIf the structural steel and other components cannot meet rigorous safety standards for nuclear operations, the plant cannot be allowed to operate. Commercial nuclear plants have been canceled for not being able to prove the quality and workmanship of safety components. \n \nThis is a serious programmatic failure. You can’t inspect in safety, you have to build it in – making sure that everything installed in this plant has the right pedigree. The contractor needs to prove that the source and quality of materials installed are validated and verified. You can’t fix this after the fact, you have to start over. The contractor failed and needs to be held accountable for this multi-billion dollar screw up.”"}

The Committee has reviewed the steps state and local election officials take to ensure the integrity of our elections and agrees that U.S. election infrastructure is fundamentally resilient. The Department of Homeland Security, the Election Assistance Commission, state and local governments, and other groups have already taken beneficial steps toward addressing the vulnerabilities exposed during the 2016 election cycle, including some of the measures listed below, but more needs to be done. \n \nThe Committee recommends the following steps to better defend against a hostile nation-state who may seek to undermine our democracy: \n \n1. Reinforce States’ Primacy in Running Elections \n States should remain firmly in the lead on running elections, and the Federal government should ensure they receive the necessary resources and information.  \n2. Build a Stronger Defense, Part I: Create Effective Deterrence \n The U.S. Government should clearly communicate to adversaries that an attack on our election infrastructure is a hostile act, and we will respond accordingly.  The Federal government, in particular the State Department and Defense Department, should engage allies and partners to establish new international cyber norms.  \n3. Build a Stronger Defense, Part II: Improve Information Sharing on Threats \n The Intelligence Community should put a high priority on attributing cyber-attacks both quickly and accurately. Similarly, policymakers should make plans to operate prior to attribution.  DHS must create clear channels of communication between the Federal government and appropriate officials at the state and local levels. We recommend that state and local governments reciprocate that communication.  Election experts, security officials, cybersecurity experts, and the media should develop a common set of precise and well-defined election security terms to improve communication.  DHS should expedite security clearances for appropriate state and local officials.  The Intelligence Community should work to declassify information quickly, whenever possible, to provide warning to appropriate state and local officials.  \n4. Build a Stronger Defense, Part III: Secure Election-Related Systems \n Cybersecurity should be a high priority for those managing election-related systems. Basic but crucial security steps like two-factor authentication for those logging into voter databases can improve the overall election security posture. States and localities should also take advantage of DHS offerings, to include DHS’s network monitoring capabilities.  The Committee recommends DHS take the following steps:  Working closely with election experts, develop a risk management framework that can be used in engagements with state and local election infrastructure owners to document and mitigate risks to all components of the electoral process. Create voluntary guidelines on cybersecurity best practices and a public awareness campaign to promote election security awareness, working through the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), and the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED).  Expand capacity to reduce wait times for DHS cybersecurity services.  Work with GSA to establish a list of credible private sector vendors who can provide services similar to those provided by DHS.   \n5. Build a Stronger Defense, Part IV: Take Steps to Secure the Vote Itself \n States should rapidly replace outdated and vulnerable voting systems. At a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability. If use of paper ballots becomes more widespread, election officials should re-examine current practices for securing the chain of custody of all paper ballots and verify no opportunities exist for the introduction of fraudulent votes.  States should consider implementing more widespread, statistically sound audits of election results.  DHS should work with vendors to educate them about the vulnerabilities of both the machines and the supply chains.  \n6. Assistance for the States \n The Committee recommends Congress urgently pass legislation increasing assistance and establishing a voluntary grant program for the states.  States should use grant funds to improve cybersecurity by hiring additional Information Technology staff, updating software, and contracting vendors to provide cybersecurity services, among other steps.  Funds should also be available to defray the costs of instituting audits.    Next Article"}

Mercedes is getting ultra-specific these days. \n\nThis is the first four-door sports coupe from Mercedes’ high-performance Affalterbach division. It’s also the latest car in a recent trend of automakers making and naming four-door vehicles “coupes”, a term that has historically referred to two-door contraptions.(BMW also debuted the M8 Gran Coupe concept, which also has four doors, in Geneva.)\n\nSuch introductions come in response to a slowed market for traditional sedans in the US market while consumer attention continues to gravitate toward crossover SUVs and smaller, sporty cars. Mercedes executives say the coupe draws inspiration from the SLS and AMG GT models, two sports cars with excellent reputations in the coupe tradition. It has the low hood, long protruding front nose, dual “power-domes” on the hood, and muscular tight haunches of the AMG GT. Each side has frameless windows and a slanted windshield; the rear wing on the V8 version can be manually fixed for maximum boy-racer effect. \n\nThe slim LED rear lamps and bumper with an enhanced wing in the back are also signature AMG touches. Say what you will about the fast-and-loose nomenclature, the AMG GT Coupe does look like it belongs in this elite family of cars.\n\nOn the inside, the Coupe will have two high-resolution controls that are each more than a foot long, much like the excellent screens in the rest of its AMG line. The rear can be configured with two carbon-fibre backed seats (they’re sporty but they don’t recline) or a split-folding “executive” rear seat that comes with a touchpad screen to control entertainment and climate settings. The car even has the first AMG fragrance, which Mercedes characterises as a “sporty” scent. More importantly, the AMG GT Coupe has the numbers – on paper at least – to back up its presence in the AMG family: It comes with optional 6-cylinder or V8 engines that have outputs ranging from 429 to 630 horsepower. The fastest Mercedes AMG GT Coupe, called the AMG GT 63 S Coupe, is a V8 version can hit 60mph (97km ph) in 3.1 seconds, with a top speed of 195mph – besting the fastest four-door Porsche sedan, the Panamera. The second-fastest, the V8 AMG GT 63 Coupe, has a 60-second sprint of 3.3 seconds, with a 193mph top speed. The third variant, a 6-cylinder AMG GT 53 Coupe, has a 4.4-second sprint and top speed of 174mph.\n\nWhether in the 6- or 8-cylinder form, expect each variant to drive with dynamic performance:They all come standard with all-wheel-drive, six drive modes, active rear-wheel steering, and nine-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifting.\n\nPricing has yet to be announced, though it’s unlikely the presumed six-figure price will deter many buyers. Deliveries begin in early 2019.\n\nWant more stories like this? Sign up here. Follow STYLE on"}
{"articleID":33446915882,"title":"Rosneft Deal May Feel Ripples of China’s Risk Clampdown: Gadfly","content":"ancial risk, which has already forced a great unwinding of overseas acquisitions by privately controlled conglomerates, may be about to claim another casualty.\n\nNews that the founder and chairman of CEFC China Energy Co. has been investigated by authorities throws into question the fate of a 14 percent stake in Russia’s Rosneft PJSC that the Chinese company agreed to buy in September. The $9 billion deal, China’s biggest international oil purchase since 2012, has yet to close.\n\nWhile the acquisition is unlikely to be scrapped, changes can’t be ruled out. The decisive factor will be what happens to CEFC, whose rapid transformation from an obscure fuel-trading business to a major overseas M&A player has fueled speculation over its political connections and sources of funds.\n\nThere are several possibilities. The most benign is that CEFC follows the path of Fosun Group, a Shanghai-based conglomerate whose chairman disappeared briefly in 2015 to assist authorities with an investigation. Though singled out for scrutiny by regulators along with other serial acquirers including HNA Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group Co., Fosun has continued to buy offshore assets since his reappearance, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nA more ominous precedent is Anbang Insurance Group Co. The government last week seized temporary control of the insurer, which also rose from obscurity in the past few years to carry out a series of headline-grabbing offshore purchases including paying almost $2 billion for New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel. Anbang also boasted political connections, with its founder having married into the family of late Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping. However, such ties may not carry the weight they once did, with President Xi Jinping consolidating power and the Communist Party proposing last week to abolish term limits -- a move that could keep him in power for life.\n\nA government takeover of CEFC could see the company come under the control of one of China’s state-owned oil giants, and might provide a pretext to renegotiate the terms of the Rosneft deal. CEFC bought the stake from a joint venture of Glencore Plc and the Qatar Investment Authority, agreeing to pay a 16 percent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average price of Rosneft shares on Sept. 8. \n\nThe stock is about 3 percent higher than when the deal was struck. Still, Rosneft has slumped 5 percent in the past three days as Exxon Mobil Corp. abandoned drilling ventures with the state-controlled company because of expanded U.S. sanctions on Russia. \n\nWhile Beijing has a strategic interest in oil cooperation with Russia, which unseated Saudi Arabia as the largest exporter of crude to China in 2016, an extended slide in Rosneft shares might offer a tempting opportunity to argue that the deal was an overly expensive acquisition by a rogue private operator that required intervention by authorities. \n\nIt’s worth noting that Rosneft is China’s biggest overseas oil acquisition since state-owned Cnooc Ltd. forked out $15.1 billion for Canada’s Nexen Inc. in 2012. The parallel is unfortunate. Nexen was a lesson in bad timing: Oil prices crashed soon after and Cnooc had to cut jobs. \n\nIt remains to be seen how serious CEFC’s difficulties prove. The investigation of founder Ye Jianming was reported by respected online financial news outlet Caixin, which didn’t say whether the probe has been concluded. The Chinese version of the story was removed from its website by Thursday afternoon in Asia.\n\nIt’s not the only controversy hanging over the company, which has been linked to allegations of corruption in Africa: The U.S. says that two men, a former Senegal politician and an ex-Hong Kong government official, paid $2 million in bribes to secure drilling contracts for CEFC. Investors aren’t waiting to find out: Shares of companies related to Ye plunged in China, Hong Kong and Singapore on Thursday.\n\nThey are probably right to be concerned. CEFC was always skating on thin ice, borrowing against a low-margin fuel trading business to fund deals for everything from brokerages and banks at home to a Czech football club and a failed attempt to acquire U.S. brokerage Cowen Inc.\n\nThe lesson of the past two weeks is that no private Chinese company borrowing heavily to finance overseas adventures is safe -- even if it’s buying commodities the country craves.\n\nPeter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a senior independent non-executive director of Glencore.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nNisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering deals and banking.

They include corporate partners Matthew Lyons, Carmelo Gordian, Alan Bickerstaff, Ted Gilman, Brian Dillavou and Russ Denton, litigation partner David Whittlesey and investment funds counsel J.R. Morgan. Lyons, who will head the Austin office, said a total of 18 lawyers will move from Andrews Kurth, including associates in the corporate and litigation practices. \n \nShearman & Sterling also plans to open a Houston office that will focus on energy transactions, including oil and gas projects. Texas Lawyer recently reported that a group of oil and gas lawyers is expected to move to Shearman’s new Houston office from Baker Botts. That team, which will be led by Baker Botts oil and gas practice chair Hugh Tucker, cannot move now because Baker Botts has a 90-day leave policy. \n \nIn an interview Wednesday, firm leaders said the Austin office is expected to have about 25 to 30 attorneys. The Houston office, which will open in a few months, will have eight to 10 partners by the end of the year. Shearman leaders said the new office openings are part of the firms “long-term strategy.” \n \nShearman is also considering a larger plan for the Austin office. Incoming senior partner David Beveridge said the firm is exploring the possibility that it would become a site for talented nonpartner track associates and staff attorneys with “quality of life” considerations. Beveridge said the Austin location is attractive because of its proximity to good universities, its venture capital business and the availability of highly skilled talent who may not want to be on the partnership track. \n \n“It’s a good spot to explore,” said Beveridge, a partner based in New York. \n \nThese considerations for the Austin office are not part of the immediate plan, however. The office will for now focus on the firm’s tech and life sciences practices. The firm already has a staff attorney location in Melville, New York. \n \nLyons said his group’s clients will benefit from Shearman & Sterling’s premier capital markets practice, M&A expertise, deep relationships with financial institutions and its network of offices on the West Coast and globally. \n \n“We felt it was time for Austin and for our clients to be part of a global elite law firm with international access to capital markets and M&A activity,” Lyons said. “Shearman is looking to us to work with the West Coast office to continue to develop and enhance the representation of emerging and start-up companies and venture capital.” \n \nLyons declined to identify the group’s clients. “We have a national group of clients centered mostly in Texas, mostly in Austin, but venture capital and private equity markets are a national market with the significant players being on the West Coast and the East Coast as well as in Texas,” he said. \n \nHe said Shearman & Sterling’s decision to be the first  New York-based firm with a full-service Austin office is a “significant milestone in the maturation of the Central Texas economy.” \n \nLyons said the Andrews Kurth/Hunton & Williams merger will be a “fantastic combination,” but his group ultimately decided that moving to Shearman & Sterling was the best thing for their clients. \n \nAndrews Kurth has lost lawyers to several firms in recent weeks as it finalized negotiations for a merger with the Virginia-based firm Hunton & Williams. That merger will take effect April 2. \n \nA spokeswoman for Andrews Kurth declined to comment on the departures. \n \nSeveral of the lawyers in the group have practiced together for more than 20 years. Many of them joined Andrews Kurth’s Austin office in 2003 after California technology firm Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison dissolved."}

Designed by Warren Platner, it became the conceptual parent of all the over-the-top top-of-the-building restaurants that followed, including some by Platner himself. Platner described it as, “Bridging the contrast in scale between great volume of space and the minute detail of food and tableware, between public gathering and personal intimacy, the design entertains the diner and gives distinction to the server in this emporium of elaborate meals.” \n \nOne travels to The American by elevator, arriving at the top of the three story-high restaurant in a carefully designed but modest entry space. As the visitor descends into the restaurant, the grand 6,500 square foot space is dramatically revealed as the terraced landings create an enormous glass lined theater with views to the city visible below. The lacy Gothic-inspired bentwood rosette-topped pillars above not only lend a “dining under the trees” feel, but, because they line the ceiling, make for an intriguing view from the street below. Miles of wood louvers cover the sheets of glass adding to the sense of tree-filtered light and making a very large space feel quite intimate. While design elements have been altered in the intervening decades, the largest gestures, including the decorative wood elements, are all intact. \n \n\"We are honored to receive the Design Icon Award from the James Beard Foundation,\" says Stacey Paine, president, Crown Center Redevelopment Corporation. “Warren Platner created a unique design, timeless in nature and a wonderful example of great architecture inspiring those around it. We are proud to have The American recognized.” \n \nBuilt and still owned by CrownCenter, the real estate development business for Hallmark Cards, the restaurant and its design is as much a confection as a considered confluence of space, form, light, and color. And because it was created by Joe Baum, in collaboration with James Beard, Barbara Kafka, and a host of other food-world luminaries, it was, and is, as much of a dining event as a design event. The American serves up a range of dining experiences from guest chef events to private dining, all under the signature wood tracery canopy that defined the space in 1974 as it does today. \n \nThe Design Icon Award is chosen by the Restaurant Design Committee. In order to qualify, a restaurant or dining space’s design must have remained substantially unchanged for at least 20 years and must have influenced and inspired the design of subsequent restaurants and dining spaces. Additionally, the restaurant/dining space must still be in operation. \n \nThe James Beard Foundation Awards Gala will be held at the Lyric Opera of Chicago on Monday, May 7, 2018. During the event, which is open to the public, awards for the Restaurant and Chef and Restaurant Design categories will be handed out, along with special achievement awards Humanitarian of the Year, Lifetime Achievement, Design Icon, Who’s Who of Food and Beverage in America, and America’s Classics. A gala reception will immediately follow, featuring top chefs and beverage professionals from across the country. \n \nOn Friday, April 27, 2018, the James Beard Media Awards, an exclusive event honoring the nation's top cookbook authors, culinary broadcast producers and hosts, and food journalists, will take place at Pier Sixty at Chelsea Piers in New York City. \n \nEstablished in 1990, the James Beard Awards recognize culinary professionals for excellence and achievement in their fields and furthers the Foundation’s mission to celebrate, nurture, and honor chefs and other leaders making America's food culture more delicious, diverse, and sustainable for everyone. Each award category has an individual committee made up of industry professionals who volunteer their time to oversee the policies, procedures, and selection of judges for their respective Awards program. All JBF Award winners receive a certificate and a medallion engraved with the James Beard Foundation Awards insignia. There are no cash prizes. \n \nThe 2018 James Beard Foundation Awards are proudly hosted by Choose Chicago and the Illinois Restaurant Association and presented in association with Chicago O’Hare and Midway International Airports as well as the following partners: Premier Sponsors: All-Clad Metalcrafters, American Airlines, HMSHost, Illinois Office of Tourism, Lavazza, S.Pellegrino Sparkling Natural Mineral Water, TABASCO Sauce, Woodford Reserve Bourbon; Supporting Sponsors: Breville, Corporate Essentials, Hyatt, Robert Mondavi Winery, Skuna Bay Salmon, Taylor Precision Products, Valrhona, Windstar Cruises; Gala Reception Sponsors: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Ecolab, Front of the House, Kendall College; with additional support from: Chefwear, Emmi Roth, Loacker, and VerTerra Dinnerware."}
{"articleID":33498260446,"title":"Georgetown Security and Software Engineering ...","content":"S2ERC's Productive Browser Project reveals Authentic8 Silo virtual browser delivers greater malware protection than Google Chrome desktop model \n\nThe Security and Software Engineering Research Center at Georgetown University (S2ERC) today released results from its Productive Browser Project that shines new light on the importance of security in the enterprise IT browser space. The study found that Silo, the secure cloud-based browser from Authentic8, provides enterprise users a higher level of protection from malware threats than Google Chrome (Chrome). A full report of the testing results can be found here (S2ERC Productive Browser Report). \n\nS2ERC researchers conducted a series of rigorous security tests to measure the capabilities of the Authentic8 and Chrome browsers to defend against many of the typical malware threats encountered by enterprise users. \n\nThe goal of the S2ERC Productive Browser Project was to determine whether a virtual browser could provide sufficient security against malicious malware threats with minimal impact on the productivity of a typical enterprise end user. The project focused on validating security properties hypothesized as a result of isolating the web browser through virtualization technology. The research initiative studied the security capabilities of virtualized, cloud-based browsers in enterprise network environments. \n\n\"The goal of this project is to research the impact that virtual browsers can have on the security of computers in corporate IT network environments,\" said Paul Brigner, S2ERC Managing Director. \"Not only did we want to compare virtual browsers' security against conventional desktop browsers but also test their capabilities while supporting a typical workload of enterprise applications to ensure there is minimal impact on users' productivity.” \n\nBrowsers are often a high-value target and attack vector for criminals and nation states who can exploit their vulnerabilities as a gateway into cloud applications and the enterprise network. By doing so, cybercriminals can compromise the security of these software as a service (SaaS) business applications in the cloud while also being able to penetrate the on premises enterprise network itself. \n\nTesting Approach\n\nTo determine the practical security benefits of a virtual browser, S2ERC researchers first cataloged a set of typical attacks. The testing team compiled a list of websites containing malicious malware code using databases from security watchdog organizations malc0de.com and vxvault.net. After verifying that these sites contained malware. The S2ERC team attempted to download infected files using these websites using both Silo and Chrome on two identically configured laptop PCs that also had a standard enterprise antivirus software installed on them. The S2ERC team attempted to download 54 files, eight of the data successfully infected the machine running Chrome while none of the sites reached the computer running Silo. In short, approximately a seventh (1/7) of the malicious sites visited by Chrome experienced a successful download while Authentic8 Silo virtual browser prevented downloads in all cases. \n\nA further examination of the results found that Silo did allow sandboxed downloading of 13 files, or about a quarter of the sample. The sandboxing - or software isolation - of these files still provided protection from direct exposure to hardware systems. \n\nWhen Silo downloaded a file, the browser sandboxed the file in cloud storage. Upon exiting the browser, the files were deleted. As such, these files never reached the test laptop nor reached the local enterprise network. \n\nWhile sandbox downloading occurred in Silo with many of the malicious sites, many of those were blocked on Chrome by either the PC's anti-virus program or Google itself. Thirty-six sites were blocked by the PC's anti-virus programs, meaning three-fifths of the malicious sites were blocked by the cybersecurity add-on. An additional four sites were blocked by Chrome. \n\nStill, the files that Chrome did download were able to successfully infect the computer. This allows for possible security breaches in an enterprise setting. While the anti-virus software should eventually find the malware, the ability for viruses to reach the computer posed a serious security threat to the users. \n\nS2ERC PRODUCTIVE BROWSER PROJECT\n\nThe S2ERC Productive Browser project marks the second and final phase of its multifaceted virtualization research project exploring benefits of a virtual browser for secure Internet use by enterprises networks. The first phase of the research evaluated the performance of virtual browsers versus conventional desktop browsers on desktop PC and MAC computers. \n\n\"It was a goal of this project to explore and test whether an isolated cloud browser can be a mechanism for improving the security and compliance of enterprise networks and data,\" added Brigner. \"The Productive Browser study validated that virtual browsers like Authentic8’s Silo help enterprises improve the security of their networks and data.\" \n\nAbout the Security and Software Engineering Research Center at Georgetown University\n\nThe Security and Software Engineering Research Center at Georgetown University (S2ERC) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored research center working on the safety, security, and stability of today's communications networks.

{"articleID":33573036031,"title":"American Airlines, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel reach O'Hare airport overhaul deal","content":"UPDATE, March 15 — American Airlines has dropped its opposition to O'Hare Airport's $8.5 billion expansion after reaching a deal with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago Tribune reported . In exchange for American's cooperation, the city will speed up construction of three new gates that the airline will use in the future, though it remains unclear when those gates will be built. The agreement, reached Wednesday night, comes as the Chicago City Council on Thursday begins to consider Emanuel's eight-year overhaul plan for the airport. \n Dive Brief:  American Airlines is threatening to sue the city of Chicago and reduce its service into O'Hare International Airport, claiming that the city cut a deal with United Airlines, giving the latter five additional gates as part of the airport's $8.5 billion planned expansion, according to Chicago Sun-Times  American said it was cut out of the negotiations that denied it three gates and that it will not sign on to the expansion deal. City officials and United deny the claims. American has launched a website with the intention of rallying employees and customers alleging that five more gates for United mean reduced competition and higher fares.  Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office is pushing for the Chicago City Council's aviation committee to approve the expansion plans and give its authorization to borrow $4 billion to get the project started. City officials said there is no additional risk for the city if American doesn't sign on to the deal, and, in fact, it would not be in the best interest for American not to become a signatory because then the airline would have no say in O'Hare operations.   Dive Insight:  \nAt the end of last month, Emanuel announced that the expansion deal was close to being finalized, and the Chicago Tribune reported that Emanuel was leveraging the fact that airline leases were about to expire to speed the process along. City officials plan on borrowing against the negotiated higher fees and airline charges to pay for construction. \n \nThe addition will take approximately eight years and will see the demolition of an older terminal, which will be replaced by a \"Global Terminal\" that will be able to accommodate large, international aircraft. \n \nThe new terminal will connect to two new satellite concourses by an underground pedestrian tunnel. The plan also includes the renovation of three existing terminals, 25% more parking space for planes, 35 new gates and the replacement of 40 current gates. The expansion will increase O'Hare's space by 3 million square feet. \n \nO'Hare already has another major construction project going on already — the airport's sixth runway . At the time of the groundbreaking, officials said the $649 million project was like adding the capacity of a third airport. The new runway will be complete in 2020 and will generate about 6,000 jobs."}

He hopes this venture helps jumpstart human colonization of the planet. \n \nHe said he believes once the hard part is over - building the spaceship - other companies and countries will jump at the opportunity of doing it themselves. \n \n'I think once we build it we'll have a point of proof something that other companies and countries can go and do. They certainly don't think it's possible, but if we do they'll up their game.'  \n \nWhen someone asked Musk how regular folk can help his mission of getting to Mars, he said right now is all about general support and encouragement.  \n     \nMusk announced last year that his private company SpaceX is working to send a cargo mission to Mars by 2022. Pictured is the Falcon Heavy launch on February 2018 \n      \nMusk admitted the first humans to dare make the trip will be risking a lot: 'It will be far more dangerous - difficult, dangerous, good chance you will die,' he conceded \n  \n'I think once we build it we'll have a point of proof something that other companies and countries can go and do.

There just aren't the same feet coming through the doors,\" said Brian Davidoff, a financial restructuring lawyer. \n \nMore than 8,000 US retail stores closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers. \n \nToys 'R' Us is also likely to liquidate in France, Spain, Poland and Australia, Brandon said, according to The Wall Street Journal. It quoted Brandon as adding that the retailer also planned to sell operations in Canada, Central Europe and Asia. \n \nToys 'R' Us was already working with liquidators Tiger Capital Group LLC, Great American Group LLC, Hilco Merchant Resources LLC and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC on previously announced store closures, and the four are expected to continue with the additional closings, sources said. \n \nThe future of the retailer's big-box shops, many located in strip centers, was uncertain. \nThe disappearance of Toys 'R' Us in the United States and the UK leaves a void for hundreds of toy makers that relied on the chain as a top customer alongside WalMart Incand Target Corp. \n \nShares in Mattel, the world's largest toymaker, and No. 2 US toymaker Hasbro tumbled last week on liquidation reports. Both companies rely on Toys 'R' Us for roughly 10 percent of their revenues, according to their 2016 annual reports. \n \n\"A large number will go to the wall,\" Muller said."}

Complementing existing computer network security systems, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, Perception is a behaviour analysis system with no rigid rules-based architecture.\n\nDhiraj Badgujar, Analyst at Frost & Sullivan, said: \"The increasing complexity of network security is becoming difficult for businesses to manage, leading to mistakes or gaps for attackers to exploit. With its deep learning capability and the ability to adapt based on changing network behaviours, Perception will enable enterprises to identify future advanced threats before they emerge.\"\n\nThe major differentiating factors of Perception are its ability to identify malicious activity without requiring prior knowledge of the threat, as well as alerting the user to potential vulnerabilities so they can be resolved before an attacker exploits them. This makes it more difficult for malware to evade detection and easier for analysts to proactively detect network vulnerabilities and user error.\n\nAs well as detecting threats and vulnerabilities as they happen, Perception uses artificial intelligence (AI) to intelligently interlink network events across months, weeks, and minutes, enabling large-volume data pattern analysis. This significantly improves \"low and slow\" threat detection capabilities, in addition to providing a low false alarm rate. Perception also detects the slow, unauthorised external extraction of information from the network, even when sophisticated obfuscation techniques are used.\n\nDaniel Driver, Head of Perception Cyber Security, who accepted the award at Frost & Sullivan's Excellence in Best Practices Awards Banquet last night, said: \"Based on declassified work for national security agencies, Perception takes the fight against cybercrime to a new level. An award from the respected international analyst firm Frost & Sullivan's gives us an unbiased, third-party stamp of approval. The Perception development team truly deserved to be recognised in this way as it proves to us that we have created something truly unique in identifying advanced cyber threats.\"\n\nFor the New Product Innovation Award, Frost & Sullivan analysts followed a 10-step evaluation process to assess Perception's fit against best practice criteria, focusing on two key factors - New Product Attributes and Customer Impact.\n\nAbout Frost & Sullivan \n\nFrost & Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.

{"articleID":33579790678,"title":"A Confident Tech Industry Revs Its Growth Engine – BDO Survey","content":"Confidence is soaring in the technology sector. A strong economy and healthy investment in the industry have U.S. technology CFOs feeling optimistic that robust growth lies ahead in 2018, according to BDO’s 2018 Technology Outlook Survey.\n\nThe vast majority (84 percent) of tech CFOs surveyed expect revenues to increase in 2018. The anticipated net increase of 12.2 percent is the highest ever recorded over the past 11 years of conducting the study. Global industry growth is projected to be strongest in the U.S. (cited by 34 percent of CFOs), followed by China (26 percent), India (24 percent), and Latin America (10 percent). Ripe market conditions have tech CFOs eager to strike deals: 48 percent expect to engage in merger and acquisition (M&A) activity this year, up from 31 percent a year ago, and 72 percent anticipate a rising volume of tech deals in the year ahead. The hefty pipeline of tech unicorns, such as Lyft and Dropbox, may finally see lift-off on their IPOs. Sixty percent of respondents believe IPO stock performance will improve in 2018. \n\nStill, significant obstacles are weighing heavily on the tech sector. Shifts in U.S. immigration policy are exacerbating the stresses of finding good tech talent, compelling major industry players to take a stand against restrictive measures. More than half (51 percent) of respondents anticipate recruiting and retaining key talent will be their greatest personal challenge this year. Scrutiny around cybersecurity vulnerabilities has also intensified, with the public demanding greater levels of accountability and transparency. \n\n“We expect 2018 to be a metamorphic year for tech, but success won’t come easy,” said Aftab Jamil, assurance partner and global leader of BDO’s Technology practice. “Leaders are battling major political and economic forces that threaten to throw them off course, from changing trade agreements to shifts in immigration policy to sweeping tax reform. Nevertheless, the industry’s resilience is not to be underestimated, nor the community’s ability to transform setbacks into opportunities.” \n\nMixed Reactions to Tax Reform\n\nTech companies have yet to determine whether the recently passed tax law, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, will ultimately have a positive or negative impact on their business. In fact, 65 percent of those surveyed after tax reform passed cite understanding its full impact on their business as their top tax reform-related challenge in 2018. \n\nNearly all CFOs surveyed post-tax reform emphasize the importance of the corporate tax rate reduction from 35 to 21 percent: 43 percent report that it will “very likely” have a significant impact on their business. While the tech industry’s average effective corporate tax rate was already well below 35 percent before reform, many companies still stand to benefit from the reduction. Nevertheless, organizations must assess the new tax provisions holistically to get an overall picture of the new tax law’s effect. \n\n“Tax reform—particularly, the corporate tax rate reduction—may be seen as a boon to the U.S. tech industry, but not all companies will emerge as clear winners,” said David Yasukochi, Tax office managing partner and co-leader of BDO’s Technology practice. “Various international tax provisions may tilt some tech companies in favor of domestic operations, but the overall impact on both domestic and international tax structures is still unclear. The first round of earnings this spring will help shed light on how tax reform is impacting the sector.” \n\nAdditional findings from the 2018 BDO Technology Outlook Survey include:\n\nElevated Cyber Confidence\n\nAs the severity and frequency of cyberattacks and data breaches intensifies across all industries, tech CFOs are investing in a more secure future for their organizations. \n\n82 percent said their organizations used new software security tools in 2017, and 37 percent hired a chief security officer. 61 percent were “very confident” in their organization’s ability to detect a data breach, and 32 percent were “somewhat confident.” 20 percent cite compliance with data privacy and protection policies as their top policy concern. \n\nMajor Investments in Cloud and Data Analytics\n\nEmerging technologies may be all the rage, but more dollars are being devoted to getting the basics right. \n\n70 percent plan to invest in cloud computing this year. 64 percent plan to deploy capital to enhance their data analytics capabilities. 85 percent have no plans to invest in artificial intelligence in 2018, and 58 percent don’t plan to invest in the Internet of Things (IoT). \n\nThese findings are from the 11th annual BDO Technology Outlook Survey, a national telephone survey conducted by Market Measurement, Inc., an independent market research consulting firm, whose executive interviewers spoke directly to 100 chief financial officers at leading technology companies throughout the U.S. The survey was conducted from December 2017 to January 2018. \n\nDownload the full report here. \n\nAbout BDO’s Technology Practice\n\nBDO has been a valued business advisor to technology companies for over 100 years.

{"articleID":33756155868,"title":"","content":"Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, has ousted its British chief executive, John Cryan, after years of losses and promoted the co-head of its retail banking arm to the top job. \n\nFollowing a two-week boardroom battle, Deutsche has appointed Christian Sewing as chief executive with immediate effect. He vowed to take “tough decisions” to return the bank to profitability.\n\nCryan, a Yorkshireman who took the helm at Deutsche in June 2015, leaves at the end of this month, two years before his contract was due to end.\n\nDeutsche has had three years of losses, and its net loss widened in the fourth quarter. Cryan has been criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures at the bank, which employs 100,000 people worldwide.\n\nAs part of the boardroom shake-up, Garth Ritchie will become sole head of the corporate and investment bank. He had shared the role with Marcus Schenck, who told the supervisory board before Easter that he would leave the bank after the annual meeting on 24 May. Ritchie and the executive board member Karl von Rohr were both appointed deputy CEOs.\n\nSewing, 47, started working for Deutsche as an apprentice in 1989 and has held roles including head of group audit and management positions in risk.\n\nHe told staff in a letter published on the bank’s website that he would thoroughly analyse how Deutsche wants to position its investment bank in a difficult market environment.\n\n“The priority is to leverage our strengths and to allocate our investments accordingly. And at the same time we will look to free up capacity for growth by pulling back from those areas where we are not sufficiently profitable,” he said.\n\nOctavio Marenzi, who runs capital markets management consultancy Opimas, said there could be job losses in London as a result.\n\n“We can expect a much stronger emphasis on the domestic German market, with a focus on commercial and retail banking, and wealth management. It looks like the board of directors is capitulating on the investment banking front. This will hit Deutsche Bank’s London presence particularly hard, where the bulk of its investment banking activity is based. We expect to see those activities right-sized or sold off, with attendant headcount reductions.”\n\nDeutsche’s chairman, Paul Achleitner, thanked Cryan for the “critical role” he played in his relatively short tenure as CEO. “However, following a comprehensive analysis we came to the conclusion that we need a new execution dynamic in the leadership of our bank.”\n\nCryan took a €400,000 pay cut last year and was paid €3.4m. He and the rest of the 13-strong management board waived their bonuses for 2017, but their collective pay still rose to €29.2m from €25.9m in 2016. \n\nCopyright © 2018 theguardian.com.

The planned facility will take up about 86,000 square feet of a large site in Rheinfelden,  Germany, and cost $35 million. Thermo Fisher expects construction to begin in the fourth quarter and complete sometime in the following 12 to 18 months.  Drug developers will be able to tap the new facility for cold and ambient clinical trial materials for their research. What's more, it offers \"a strategic logistical location for shipping either by road or air,\" according to the contract manufacturer.          Dive Insight:  \nIt costs a lot to bring a medicine to market. An oft-cited figure from the Tufts Center for Study of Drug Development estimates companies shell out an average of $2.6 billion per approved therapy, factoring in both the out-of-pocket and time expenses. \n \nThose costs, combined with a slew of other factors , have caused returns on R&D to shrink in recent years. \n \nThe industry hasn't figured out a remedy to this problem. But in the meantime, they've increasingly turned to contract researchers and manufacturers like Thermo Fisher for services that normally are more expensive to perform in-house. \n \nKeeping up with demand is difficult, however.

{"articleID":33524253732,"title":"Father and Son Convicted Following Trial in $16.7 Million Health Care Fraud Scheme","content":"DALLAS – Yesterday, following a 10-day trial before U.S. Chief District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn, a jury convicted Terry Lynn Anderson, 67, and Rocky Freeland Anderson, 37, of Dallas, on multiple felony counts related to a health care fraud scheme they operated, announced Erin Nealy Cox, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas. \n \nThe jury convicted the father and son duo on one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, eight counts of health care fraud, and four counts of aggravated identity theft. The jury convicted Terry Anderson on two additional health care fraud counts. \n \nThe evidence at trial showed that the defendants defrauded Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas (Blue Cross) by submitting claims on behalf of employees of American Airlines, Inc. for hearing aids that were not needed and, in many cases, never dispensed to the patient. The fraudulent claims were submitted through Anderson Optical & Hearing Aids Center, the defendants’ family-owned business that had locations in Arlington and Bedford. \n \nTo increase the number of claims they could submit to Blue Cross, the defendants engaged in fraudulent marketing practices. For example, the defendants promised patients a free pair of high-end sunglasses or a free pair of prescription eyeglasses in exchange for taking a free hearing test. At the conclusion of these hearing tests, the defendants told patients that they had slight to mild hearing loss and required them to sign an order for hearing aids in order to receive the free glasses. The defendants promised patients that the hearing aids would be provided to them at no cost, and that Anderson Optical & Hearing would waive any applicable copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles. The defendants also offered patients $100 gift cards in exchange for referring family members and coworkers for free hearing tests. \n \nIn 2012, the pair brought their fraud scheme into American Airlines’ airport facilities and started offering free hearing tests to aircraft mechanics and fleet services clerks in maintenance hangars and employee breakrooms. Attracted by the offer of free sunglasses, the pair often had long lines of employees waiting to be tested. However, an expert witness who testified for the government explained that the cursory screening tests the defendants performed, which witnesses described as lasting 3-5 minutes, were incapable of producing results upon which a one could make a legitimate decision to dispense hearing aids. Witnesses from Blue Cross testified that these cursory screening tests also failed to comply with Blue Cross’s medical policies related to the evaluation of hearing impairment. \n \nThe evidence also showed that, in November 2013, Blue Cross conducted an audit of Anderson Optical & Hearing and requested copies of patient records for certain American Airlines employees and their dependents. On January 6, 2014, the Texas Department of State Health Services-Professional Licensing Unit (Professional Licensing Unit) began an investigation regarding a complaint it had received concerning the Andersons. In February 2014, when given the opportunity to respond to the complaint, the defendants submitted several patient records to the Professional Licensing Unit, including some of the same patient records that had been collected by Blue Cross. The patient records submitted to the Professional Licensing Unit had altered test scores and additional notations that were not present when the same records were submitted to Blue Cross in November 2013. \n \nDuring the period of the conspiracy, Anderson Optical & Hearing submitted claims to Blue Cross for hearing aids on behalf of American Airlines employees totaling more than $27 million.  As a result of these claims, Blue Cross paid Anderson Optical & Hearing more than $16.7 million. \n \nAt trial, Terry Anderson took the stand in his own defense. In an attempt to shift the blame on to patients who were more interested in his offer of free sunglasses that they were in hearing aids, he testified, “Well, unfortunately among us are people that will take advantage of perhaps any program, if they have an opportunity to.” \n \nThe defendants face a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine for the conspiracy count and for each of the substantive health care fraud counts. The aggravated identity theft counts carry a mandatory statutory penalty of two years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000. \n \nThe superseding indictment includes a forfeiture notice that requires the defendants to forfeit a 300 acre ranch in Bosque County, three vehicles, and more than $3.1 million that was seized from nine financial accounts in December 2015. \n \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Douglas Brasher and Rachael Jones prosecuted. \n \n# # #"}

{"articleID":33552615297,"title":"Trump halts Broadcom’s $117 bn bid to buy Qualcomm","content":"US President Donald Trump today blocked Singapore-based company Broadcom’s USD 117 billion bid for chip maker Qualcomm, citing national security concern. Trump, in his executive order, said there is “credible evidence” that leads him to believe that if Broadcom Limited took control of the US-based Qualcomm it “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the US.” \n \nAs such, Broadcom and Qualcomm “shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover”, ordered the US President. “The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,” Trump said in the executive order issued today. \n \nTrump’s decision in this regard comes after Broadcom said last Friday that it will ask its shareholders to approve its plan to redomicile to the US. In such a scenario, Broadcom -- which currently works under the laws of Singapore -- would have been considered as an American company and thus its proposed USD 117 billion would have been considered outside the preview of a federal agency -- Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — that reviews foreign deal. \n \nIn a letter, the CFIUS had confirmed the national security concerns. Last week, the CFIUS issued an interim order to Qualcomm directing it to postpone its annual stockholders meeting and election of directors by 30 days. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in his capacity as the chair of the CFIUS, said Trump’s decision was consistent with the administration’s commitment to take all actions necessary to protect the national security of the US. \n \n“This decision is based on the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only and is not intended to make any other statement about Broadcom or its employees, including its thousands of hardworking and highly skilled US employees,” Mnuchin said. “The CFIUS process focuses exclusively on identifying and addressing national security concerns. This focused mandate reinforces our commitment to welcoming foreign investment, while at the same time reinforcing our commitment to protecting national security,” he added. \n \nChina is the reason? \n \nChina is said to be the main reason behind Trump’s decision, US daily The New York Times said. Last week, several US lawmakers had called for stopping Broadcom’s takeover of Qualcomm. Congressman Duncan Hunter said that the merger would “damage American security” and had pointed at Broadcom’s “increasing” ties with China to highlight his reservation about the deal. \n \n“This should concern us as a nation. These ties were most recently reflected in the agreements Broadcom signed with HBC, Inspur and StarTimes. China has a finely honed capability to access the technology of companies such as Broadcom, along with that of their subsidiaries and acquisitions,” he said. Hunter said the merger would make Broadcom the third largest chipmaker in the world, “giving them control over a major portion of the supply chain, which is critical to the vital communications components.” \n \n“Such a company, if subjected to national or terrorist interests adverse to America, could install lockout features to block our security agencies from monitoring mobile data. The possibilities for damaging US security are limitless,” the lawmaker said. \n \nSenator Tom Cotton said that Qualcomm’s work is too important to the US’ national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company-and in a hostile takeover no less. “Its hard to see a good reason why we should hand over one of our leading computer-chip makers, and thereby give Chinese companies a leg-up in the race to develop 5G and the next generation of technology. Better to keep it in American hands and protect American national security,” Cotton said."}

The alliance has drawn on each member's expertise across the defence and commercial sectors, and draws on proven power and propulsion capability and over 30 years of unique Type 45 design, build and support experience.\n\nDavid Mitchard, Managing Director, BAE Systems Maritime Services, said: \"We are immensely proud to support the Royal Navy's Type 45 fleet whether at home or on deployment around the world. By combining the collective knowledge, experience and skills of BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and BMT we are demonstrating our commitment to present a robust technical solution with an innovative commercial alliance. Our aim is to rapidly restore command confidence in the power and propulsion system of the Type 45 fleet, demonstrate value for money and safeguard vital skills for future generations of warship support.\"\n\nJeremy Berwick, Managing Director, BMT Defence and Security, said: \"We firmly believe in the power of teamwork and this agreement sets the seal on the coming together of three highly complementary partners to form the very best team. We look forward to working with our partners to deliver a fresh, lean and rapid solution for the Royal Navy.\"\n\nLinton Roberts, Managing Director, Cammell Laird, said: \"Cammell Laird is delighted and proud to have been selected to undertake the Type 45 Power Improvement Programme in partnership with BAE Systems and BMT. This highly collaborative approach is very much in line with the Government's National Shipbuilding Strategy by maximising the effectiveness of the complementary expertise and experience of each partner. The Ministry of Defence has driven a challenging competition for this contract, and we are confident that our Alliance will deliver a very innovative technical solution to the Royal Navy.\"\n\nThe scope of the PIP competition was split into two lots, comprising major procurement, design and integration of the solution, and the physical installation and replacement of equipment onboard the Type 45 vessels. The BAE Systems-led team competed in and won both lots, with work set to begin immediately.\n\nThe installation and replacement of equipment is planned to take place at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead, Merseyside, before a series of harbour and sea trials will enable the ships to return to their home at Portsmouth Naval Base, where they will return to Royal Navy operations supported by BAE Systems.\n\nThe Type 45 fleet is supported by BAE Systems at home and overseas. The Type 45 destroyers are the United Kingdom's most advanced air defence warship and resolving the power and propulsion issues will allow the Royal Navy to carry out its full range of operations to protect UK and NATO interests anywhere around the world, with confidence in the power and propulsion system.© 2018 Targeted Service, source Service"}

Citgo [PDVSAC.UL], fully owned by PDVSA, operates a 749,000 barrel-per-day refining network. \n \nMercuria declined to comment. \n \nThe commodities firm has a long trading relationship with Citgo Petroleum that allows the U.S.-based refiner to acquire oil on preferential terms. \n \nThose terms have been helping Citgo buy crude for its refineries since President Donald Trump’s administration last year imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela, PDVSA and its subsidiaries, limiting their access to long-term credit. \n \nRosneft also has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014. \n \nVenezuela in 2016 gave Rosneft the 49.9-percent collateral in Citgo in return for a $1.5 billion loan. The remaining 50.1 percent of Citgo provides the collateral to holders of PDVSA’s 2020 bond. \n \nRosneft and PDVSA were negotiating a swap of the collateral for other assets to avoid complications stemming from the sanctions. But those talks do not seem to have advanced very far, sources said. \n \nThe investors applied for a license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to assume the lien, according to a U.S. investor and documents seen by Reuters. \n \nThe request, submitted in early October, has received basic technical approval but the group has yet to receive an answer from the U.S. government, according to the source. \n   \nReporting by Julia Payne in London and Alexandra Ulmer in Washington; Writing by Marianna Parraga; Editing by Lisa Shumaker \n   Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}

He added that Toys 'R' Us also planned to sell operations in Canada, Central Europe and Asia. \n \nToys 'R' Us is trying to package its Canadian business with 200 US stores and find a buyer, the CEO said, according to the Journal . \n \nThe company had already been working with liquidators Tiger Capital Group LLC, Great American Group LLC, Hilco Merchant Resources LLC and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC on previously announced store closures, and the four are expected to continue with the additional closings, sources said. — Reuters"}

SpaceX's first satellites are expected to come online next year. \n \nThe proposed satellite network would differ from current satellite data technology, which is slow and expensive. Under Musk's plan, SpaceX's satellite fleet would orbit much closer to Earth than traditional communications satellites that stay in geostationary orbit high above Earth. That means data will travel to and from the satellite much more quickly - increasing the speed and reliability of the connection. \n \n\"Although we still have much to do with this complex undertaking,\" said SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell, this is an important step toward the company building a next-generation satellite network that can link the globe with reliable and affordable broadband service, especially reaching those who are not yet connected.\""}

Billed as the best sports and live entertainment venue in Atlanta with approximately 160 events and over 1.6 guests visiting annually, the arena and its transformation with the City of Atlanta recently won Rehab/Renovation Deal of the Year in the Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 2018 Best in Atlanta Real Estate Awards. \n \nThe Preview experience flows like an unforgettable night out, beginning in an inviting “green room”-like welcome area with a club lounge feel and curated wall full of iconic sports and music memorabilia to spark interest and conversation. A series of technology-powered main events follow—all choreographed and tailored to each visitor’s interests. From an inspiring video projected onto a curved theater wall that responds to guests’ movements, to a scale model inviting interaction and exploration of the new arena, there are many twists and turns to discover. The experience culminates in a relaxed conversation area inspired by the features and feel of the new arena suites, and the entertainment vibe, unique spirit and Southern charm of Atlanta itself. \n \n“Our objective was to create an experience with the Hawks that brought together cutting-edge technology, storytelling and physical space to excite, inspire and persuade visitors,” said Jeff Alpen, Hornall Anderson Managing Director. “The space is a beautiful combination of innovation, exploration and function and celebrates the uniqueness and vibrancy of Atlanta and its people.” \n \nDesigned to build anticipation and reward curiosity, the sales center puts visitors in control of their experience, while empowering the Hawks’ salespeople with the tools needed to be responsive to their guests. \n \n“As a renovation of an existing building, we wanted the sales center to be a reflection of our approach to the building – and that’s to use new technologies to create immersive social experiences for our fans,” said Thad Sheely, Atlanta Hawks Chief Operating Officer. “That’s exactly what the Preview is – it feels more like a Disney ride than a sales center and is a true emotional and physical expression of what we strive to create in the reimagined Arena.” \n \nA further look into the design of the Atlanta Hawks Sales Center experience is available in Hornall Anderson’s case study at: https://www.hornallanderson.com/atlanta-hawks . \n \nAbout Hornall Anderson \n \nHornall Anderson designs how brands and people come together.

{"articleID":33559106421,"title":"American Furniture Warehouse to expand to 3 Houston suburbs","content":"The American Furniture Warehouse store in Glendale, Ariz., that the new Houston-area stores will be modeled after.  ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — American Furniture Warehouse is planning three large warehouse showroom stores in fast-growing Houston suburbs to the north, south and west, President and CEO Jake Jabs confirmed this week. \nWhile the land deals have yet to be finalized, AFW expects to open 300,000-square-foot buildings in Webster, Texas, to the south; Conroe, Texas, to the north; and Katy, Texas, west of Houston. Each will feature 100,000-square-foot showrooms with attached 200,000-square-foot warehouses. \nNone of the land deals are finalized, and Jabs said the Katy piece is particularly complicated, but he hopes to have a Webster store up and running by this time next year. The others would follow as soon as possible. \n“We’ve got the money. It’s just a matter of getting approvals,” Jabs said. He didn’t want to disclose projected sales for the market, but said annual sales between $75 million to $100 million per store would be a fair ballpark estimate. \n \nAFW previously confirmed its interest in the market but has been reluctant to elaborate on the details as none of the projects have been finalized. However, bits and pieces of the plan have surfaced this year, leading Jabs first to confirm he was negotiating for land in Webster . \n \nThis past week, Conroe City Council a pproved an incentives package for a future AFW store in that market, and the mayor officially welcomed the retailer to the community. But even there, Jabs said the deal is not done and that the retailer awaits approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land. That could take months or years, he said. \n \nWhile AFW has opened satellite stores in Colorado — the result of acquiring other retailers — the Houston locations will be built from the ground up and modeled after the large warehouse showrooms it operates in greater Phoenix, Ariz. \n \n“The reason we’re so successful in Arizona is because we’re like the (brick-and-mortar) Amazon, offering immediate fulfilment,” he said. “You come in and buy it. You can take with it with your or have it delivered in a day or two. That’s today’s customer.” \n \nHouston is an appealing new market for the retailer partly because AFW works best in big-city markets. “We’ve had stores in Montana and Wyoming, but I’ve learned we’re geared for big populations,” he said. “To make our thing work, we’ve got to do a lot of volume.” \n \nAs it has before previous expansions, Jabs said AFW rented a helicopter to get a better view of housing developments and where the city’s population was heading. All three suburbs fit the bill for fast growth, including Conroe, which posted the fastest growth of any large city (population of 50,000 or more) in the nation in 2016, according to PBM Strategic Insights. Conroe’s population grew 7.8% over 2015 to more than 82,000 people — 11 times the national population growth rate. \n \nJabs called Houston a “good city with a lot going on.” \n \n“The economy is strong and growing, and there are a lot of roof tops,” he said. “That’s what we need — rooftops.” \n \nAFW is No. 19 on Furniture Today’s most recent Top 100 with estimated furniture, bedding and accessory sales of $640 million at 14 Colorado and Arizona stores.

(http://s.nikkei.com/2tmllLY) \n\nRicoh and legacy companies that supply office printing equipment such as Xerox Corp have been looking to sell assets and focus on other areas of growth as paper printing increasingly gives way to digital alternatives. \n\nEarlier this year, Japan's Fujifilm Holdings said it would buy Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal to gain scale and cut costs. That proposal has, however, hit road blocks as two of Xerox's top shareholders — Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason — opposed the deal. \n  \nRicoh, meanwhile, has already cut over 5,000 jobs in North America since beginning of this year, the Nikkei said. \n \nThe 59-year old company has reported declining profits for the past four years. Its stock has shed nearly two-thirds of its market value since its peak in 2007. \n\nRicoh did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. \n\nThe Nikkei said last month that Ricoh was conducting impairment tests on its slumping North American business, and may have to take a related charge of about 100 billion yen ($943.04 million). \n\nThe company will sell a copier factory in the Chinese industrial hub Shenzhen and is planning to dispose of its equity stake in a Coca-Cola distributor for about 56 billion yen ($528.50 million), the Japanese business daily reported on Thursday. \n\nExpenses related to the job cuts and other restructuring efforts are expected to weigh on the company's fiscal 2018 performance, the Nikkei reported. \n\nRicoh will also set aside 200 billion yen for acquisitions of commercial and industrial printing companies as it looks to move away from office printing, according to the report. \n\n($1 = 106.0400 yen) \n\n(Reporting By Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sayantani Ghosh)"}

The €107.5 million sale of 8.6 acres of RTÉ’s Montrose campus to the home builder was described as the most notable land transaction in Dublin of the year. \n \nIn May, chief executive Michael Stanley said the company planned to sell non-core sites – those deemed too small to fit its business model. It expected to realise about €50 million from the sale of such sites by the end of 2018. \n \nIn January, however, Cairn Homes released a trading update that showed operating costs for the second half of the year had increased, a potential dud note in an otherwise promising performance. \n \nVolumes have increased by almost four times those of 2016, it said, and the company expected to sell off 10 sites by the middle of this year. \n \nIn the full year to December, Cairn Homes had completed 418 homes, jumping from 105 in 2016, and average selling prices, somewhat unsurprisingly, had increased by 6 per cent. \n \nAlthough it had guided a full year Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of between €14.5 million and €15 million, Davy said this was well behind its own estimate of €17.4 million “driven by a further increase in operating costs”. \n Wednesday  \nResults:  Breedon Group , Corbion , Deutsche Post DHL, Paddy Power Betfair, Panalpina , Abercrombie & Fitch. \n  \nIndicators: Irish consumer confidence (Feb), industrial production (Jan), retail sales (Jan); UK house price index (Feb); US exports and imports (Jan). \n \nMeetings: IntraTradeIreland Venture Capital Conference 2018 (Crown Plaza Belfast); GDPR information session: What you should be doing now (Mansion House, Dublin). \n Thursday  \nResults: Dell Technologies, Irish Continental Group. \n \nIndicators: Irish GDP (Q4); German factory orders (Jan); \n \nMeetings: ECB interest rate decision; Cantillon 2018 conference on digital borders after Brexit (Rose Hotel, Tralee , Co Kerry); Cork University Business School Conference (Opera House, Cork); Alltech Craft Brews and Food Fair (Convention Centre Dublin). \n \nThe craft beer business never seems to lose momentum, propelled further by a report this month that showed sales rose by 47 per cent last year, now accounting for 4 per cent of beer sales overall. \n \nThe AIB research on the pub sector also showed food continues to be an important revenue earner. Sales there rose by 3 per cent last year, with pubs accounting for 37 per cent of the €2.6 billion food service market in Ireland. \n \nNew lending to pubs in the 12 months to the end of September 2017 also rose by 65 per cent, reaching €86 million. \n \nThere’s so much good news for the sector it warrants a celebratory pint and the Alltech Craft Brews and Food Fair (starting Thursday and running to Saturday) is the obvious place to enjoy it. \n \nIn a vibrant market, the fair exhibits the finest in beers and food of the type increasingly enjoyed by Irish consumers. \n \n“Ireland’s largest gathering of craft brewers and distillers” is now in its sixth year and will host more than 50 exhibitors showcasing the latest innovations and trends. \n \n“In a positive outlook for the future almost two-thirds of our exhibitors have indicated that they are planning to increase their employee numbers in 2018,” said spokesman Conor Farrell . \n \n“Many [OTHERS ARE] also expanding their offering into the growing food tourism area through the development of visitor attractions.” \n \nFriday \n \nIndicators: Irish construction output (Q4), new car sales (Feb); UK construction output (Jan), industrial and manufacturing production (Jan); German industrial production (Jan), exports and imports (Jan); US non-farm payrolls and unemployment (Feb)."}
{"articleID":33663177204,"title":"Kaspersky Report: Energy and ICS Integration companies face highest chance of cyberattack","content":"– A report from Kaspersky Lab found that in the second half of 2017, nearly 40 percent of all industrial control systems (ICS) in energy organizations protected by Kaspersky Lab solutions were attacked by malware at least once – closely followed by 35 percent of engineering & ICS integration networks. \n \nThe Kaspersky Lab report, “ Threat Landscape for Industrial Automation Systems in H2 2017 ,” also found that for all other industries (manufacturing, transportation, utilities, food, healthcare, etc.) the proportion of ICS computers attacked ranged from 26 percent to 30 percent on average. The vast majority of detected attacks were accidental hits. \n \nThe cybersecurity of industrial facilities remains an issue that can lead to very serious consequences affecting industrial processes, as well as businesses losses. While analyzing the threat landscape in different industries, Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT recorded that nearly all industries regularly experience cyberattacks on their ICS computers. However, there are two industries that were attacked more than others – energy organizations (39%), and engineering and ICS integration businesses (35%). \n \nThe sector that demonstrated the most noticeable growth of ICS computers attacked during the second half of 2017 (compared to the first half of 2017) was construction, with 31 percent attacked. The relatively high percentage of attacked ICS computers in the construction industry compared to the first half of 2017 could indicate that these organizations are not necessarily mature enough to pay the required attention to the protection of industrial computers. Their computerized automation systems might be relatively new and an industrial cybersecurity culture is still being developed in these organizations. \n \nThe lowest percentage of ICS attacks – 15 percent – has been found in enterprises specializing in developing ICS software, meaning that their ICS research/development laboratories, testing platforms, demo stands and training environment are also being attacked by malicious software, although not as often as the ICS computers of industrial enterprises. Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT experts point to the significance of ICS vendors’ security, because the consequences of an attack spreading over the vendor’s partner ecosystem and customer base could be very dramatic – as seen during the ExPetr malware epidemic. \n \nAmong the new trends of 2017, Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT researchers have discovered a rise in mining attacks on ICS. This growth trend began in September 2017, along with an increase in the cryptocurrency market and miners in general. But in the case of industrial enterprises, this type of attack can pose a greater threat by creating a significant load on computers, and as a result, negatively affecting the operation of the enterprise’s ICS components and threatening their stability. \n \nOverall, during the period from February 2017 to January 2018, cryptocurrency mining programs attacked three percent of industrial automation system computers, in most cases accidentally. \n \nOther highlights from the report include: \n Kaspersky Lab products blocked attempted infections on 38% of ICS computers protected by them. This is 1.4 percentage points less than in the second half of 2016.  The internet remains the main source of infection with 22.7% of ICS computers attacked. This is two percent higher than in the first six months of the year. The percentage of blocked web-borne attacks in Europe and North America is substantially lower than elsewhere.  The top five countries  by percentage of ICS computers attacked has remained unchanged since reported in the first half of 2017. This includes Vietnam (70%), Algeria (66%), Morocco (60%), Indonesia (60%) and China (60%).  In the second half of 2017, the number of different malware modifications detected by Kaspersky Lab solutions installed on industrial automation systems increased from 18,000 to over 18,900 .  In 2017, 11% of all ICS systems were attacked by botnet agents, a malware that secretly infects machines and includes them in a botnet network for remote command execution; the main sources of attacks like this were the internet, removable media and email messages.  In 2017, Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT identified 63 vulnerabilities in industrial systems and IIoT/IoT systems, and 26 of them have been fixed by vendors.  \n“ The results of our research into attacked ICS computers in various industries have surprised us, said Evgeny Goncharov, head of Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT. “For example, the high percentage of ICS computers attacked in power and energy companies demonstrated that the enterprises’ effort to ensure cybersecurity of their automation systems after some serious incidents in the industry is not enough, and there are multiple loopholes still there that cybercriminals can use.” \n \nKaspersky Lab ICS CERT recommends the following technical measures to be taken: \n Regularly update operating systems, application software and security solutions on systems that are part of the enterprise’s industrial network.  Restrict network traffic on ports and protocols used on the edge routers and inside organization's OT networks.  Audit ICS component access control in the enterprise’s industrial network and at its boundaries.  Deploy dedicated endpoint protection solutions onto ICS servers, workstations and HMIs to secure OT and industrial infrastructure from random cyberattacks.  Deploy network traffic monitoring, analysis and detection solutions for better protection from targeted attacks.  \nTo read the full report, “Threat Landscape for Industrial Automation Systems in H2 2017 ,” please visit the Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT website here . \n \nAbout Kaspersky Lab \n \nKaspersky Lab is a global cybersecurity company, which has been operating in the market for over 20 years. Kaspersky Lab’s threat intelligence and security expertise is constantly transforming into next generation security solutions and services to protect businesses, critical infrastructure, governments and consumers around the globe."}

{"articleID":33671059126,"title":"DAIMLER : BMW Group and Daimler AG agree to combine mobility services","content":"* Automotive pioneers and innovation leaders to shape sustainable urban mobility of the future\n\n* Strong alliance to create unique customer offering: seamless, multimodal, fast and readily available\n\n* Ecosystem for on-demand mobility: single source for CarSharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodality\n\n* Sustainable solutions for challenges of urban mobility and better quality of life in big cities\n\n* Joint-venture concept will ensure expansion of digital business models at both companies\n\nMunich/Stuttgart -- The BMW Group and Daimler AG are joining forces to offer customers a single source for sustainable urban mobility services. The two companies today signed an agreement to merge their mobility services business units. Subject to examination and approval by the responsible competition authorities, the BMW Group and Daimler AG plan to combine and strategically expand their existing on-demand mobility offering in the areas of CarSharing, Ride-Hailing, Parking, Charging and Multimodality. Each company will hold a 50-percent stake in a joint-venture model comprising both companies' mobility services. The two companies will remain competitors in their respective core businesses.\n\nThe aim of this transaction is to become a leading provider of innovative mobility services. Both automotive manufacturers aim to shape the mobility of the future to be able to offer their customers unique experiences and support their partners, such as cities and communes, in achieving sustainable urban mobility.\n\nThe partners intend to offer their customers a holistic ecosystem of intelligent, seamlessly connected mobility services, available at the tap of a finger. Together, the BMW Group and Daimler AG plan to grow this new business model sustainably and enable rapid global scaling of services. Working as partners, both companies are thereby addressing the challenges arising from urban mobility and changing customer wishes, and cooperating with cities, municipalities and other interest groups to improve quality of life in major cities. The merger will promote electromobility, for example, by offering electrified CarSharing vehicles, as well as easy access to charging and parking options. As a result, it will become even easier to experience and use sustainable mobility services.\n\n\"The BMW Group is shaping future mobility - and striking out in new directions to do so. Our Strategy NUMBER ONE  NEXT provides the BMW Group with a roadmap to a digital and emission-free future,\" said Harald Krüger, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. \"Combining our mobility services as planned will create a unique digital ecosystem. This alliance will make it easier for our customers to discover the emission-free mobility of the future. We remain competitors when it comes to the best premium vehicles. The planned merger of our mobility services will pool our resources and sends a strong signal to our new competitors,\" added Krüger.\n\n\"As pioneers in automotive engineering, we will not leave the task of shaping future urban mobility to others. There will be more people than ever before without a car who will still want to be extremely mobile. We want to combine our expertise and experience to develop a unique, sustainable ecosystem for urban mobility,\" said Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars. \"At Daimler, we are vigorously and systematically pursuing our transformation from automobile manufacturer to provider of mobility services with our CASE strategy. CASE stands for connectivity, automated driving, sharing & services and electric mobility.\"\n\n\"The future of mobility lies in cities: The key to more liveable cities is in intelligent and seamless services that are easy to use and combine sustainable modes of transport and mobility services,\" said Peter Schwarzenbauer, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for MINI, Rolls-Royce, BMW Motorrad, Customer Engagement and Digital Business Innovation BMW Group. \"The pioneering work and commitment of the employees who provide our services have laid a valuable foundation. I would like to thank them very much indeed for all that they have done,\" Schwarzenbauer continued.\n\n\"The sustainable mobility of tomorrow is flexible and connected - a vision we share with our partner, the BMW Group,\" explained Bodo Uebber, member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Finance & Controlling and Daimler Financial Services. \"Together, we can offer millions of customers highly-attractive products and services to make their lives easier and their environment a better place to live. The options offered by the planned joint venture-concept will complement mobility services offered by cities.\"\n\nThe equally-owned joint venture model is designed to combine services in the following five areas:\n\n1) Multimodal and on-demand mobility with moovel and ReachNow: Intelligent and seamless connectivity between different mobility offerings - including booking and payment - will create significant added value for users. It will also offer possible solutions for the challenges of urban private transport.\n\n2) CarSharing with Car2Go and DriveNow:\n\nCar2Go and DriveNow operate a total of 20,000 vehicles in 31 major international cities. CarSharing enables better utilisation of vehicles and thus helps reduce the total number of vehicles in cities. More than four million customers already use these CarSharing services.\n\n3) Ride-Hailing with mytaxi, Chauffeur Prive, Clever Taxi and Beat: With 's largest taxi app, simply order a taxi or use a licensed driver in France for a ride in the French metropolises. In total, 13 million customers and some 140,000 drivers are already using the modern, practical and fast way of Ride-Hailing with mytaxi, Clever Taxi and Beat or private hire vehicle service Chauffeur Prive. Innovative offers such as mytaximatch, in which people not known to each other share a taxi at a fingertip, make an important contribution to reducing inner-city traffic by eliminating numerous individual trips in the urban space.\n\n4) Parking with ParkNow and Parkmobile Group/Parkmobile LLC:\n\nTicketless, cashless on-street parking or help finding, reserving and paying for off-street parking in a garage. Innovative digital parking services reduce the time and the amount of driving involved in finding a parking space. This will reduce traffic significantly, as cars searching for parking spaces currently account for around 30% of road traffic.\n\n5) Charging with ChargeNow and Digital Charging Solutions:\n\nEasy access (incl. location, charging and payment) to the world's largest network of public charging stations with more than 143,000 charging points worldwide. Combined with parking privileges in cities, this will support the expansion of electromobility, by helping people get to know this drive technology and integrate it easily into their mobility needs.\n\nThe formation of the joint venture will produce a significant valuation and earnings effect at Daimler Financial Services. If the approval of the competition authorities is received this year, following adjustments will be made to the group outlook for Daimler AG: The company expects EBIT for Daimler Financial Services to be significantly higher than the previous year; for the Group as a whole, this means EBIT is likely to be slightly higher than the previous year.\n\nIf approved by the relevant authorities in the course of this year, the formation of the joint venture will trigger a one-time valuation and earnings effect in the BMW AG's group financial statement and thus lead to an adjustment of the company's guidance: Under these circumstances, pre-tax earnings on Group level would increase slightly in 2018 compared with the previous year. The valuation and earnings effect would have no impact on the EBIT margin in the automotive segment.\n\nThe joint project is subject to examination and approval by the respective competition authorities. The best-possible customer experience is already the focus of both partners' services. Therefore, initially nothing will change for the millions of customers, with existing services still being provided to the same extent and with the same level of quality.\n\nBMW Group\n\nGlenn Schmidt\n\nHead of Business and Finance Communications\n\nTelephone: +49 89 382-24544\n\n[email protected]\n\nBMW Group\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann\n\nBusiness and Finance Communications\n\nTelephone: +49 89 382-24118\n\n[email protected]\n\nDaimler AG\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nHendrik Sackmann\n\nTelephone: +49 711 17-35014\n\n[email protected]\n\nDaimler AG\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nSilke Walters\n\nTelephone: 49 711 17-40624\n\n[email protected]\n\nThis document contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views about future events.

The location of the plant, expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2020, has not been announced. \n \nOn completion in 2020, the new facility will process 8 million pounds of milk per day, producing an estimated 300 million pounds of cheese and whey products annually. \n \nGlanbia will hold 50 percent of the equity of the new Michigan joint venture, with DFA and Select holding the balance of equity. The Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) will continue to participate in the project as a milk supplier. \n \nGlanbia will be the operational, technical and commercial partner in the project, which mirrors the arrangement the three partners have in the Southwest Cheese (SWC) facility in Clovis, New Mexico. \n Agropur expanding South Dakota cheese plant  \nAgropur broke ground on a $250 million expansion to its cheese manufacturing facility at Lake Norden, South Dakota. The plant’s milk processing capacity will be tripled, from 3 million to 9 million pounds per day, equal to the output of an additional 85,000 cows. \n \nThe expanded plant is expected to be fully operational by early 2019, making it one of the largest cheese and whey plants in the Midwest. \n \n“Increasing our milk processing capacity will enable us to take advantage of the growing milk supply in the I-29 corridor and to better serve our customers,” said Doug Simon, president of Agropur’s U.S. operations. \n \nAgropur Inc. is a subsidiary of Agropur Cooperative, a 3,290-member co-op based in Canada. The company reported sales of $6.4 billion in 2017, processing more than 13 billion pounds of milk per year at its 39 plants across North America. \n Land O’Lakes Inc. reports record earnings  \nLand O'Lakes Inc. released 2017 financial data , reporting record earnings for the year ending Dec. 31, 2017, up 14 percent from 2016. \n \nLand O'Lakes’ Dairy Foods division reported 2017 net sales of $3.9 billion, up from $3.8 billion in 2016. Pretax earnings totaled $71 million in 2017, up from $70.1 million in 2016. \n \nThe company’s branded butter realized improved margins, while margins in the global dairy ingredients business were lower due to a challenging operating environment for global milk powders and other key dairy markets. \n \nThe acquisition of Vermont Creamery, announced last March, expanded the division's portfolio to include more specialty, artisanal and premium-style dairy products. Vermont Creamery produces goat cheeses, cultured butter and fresh dairy at the creamery in Websterville, Vermont. \n \nOverall, the company reported a record $364.8 million in net earnings on $13.7 billion in sales in 2017. It marked the fourth consecutive year of positive net earnings growth. \n Foremost Farms USA to sell pharmaceutical lactose business to Kerry  \nForemost Farms USA Cooperative agreed to sell its pharmaceutical lactose business to international food ingredients and flavor company Kerry. Terms were not disclosed. \n \nForemost Farms, headquartered in Baraboo, Wisconsin, is a farmer-owned milk processing and marketing cooperative with about 1,400 dairy farmer members and annual sales of $1.5 billion. In a long-term agreement, the cooperative will continue to provide milk solids to the plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. \n \nForemost Farms and Kerry have had a long-standing strategic relationship in the business. The plant currently manufactures branded lactose products under both the Foremost brand, FastFlo, and Kerry brand, Sheffield. Kerry markets those products worldwide. \n \n“Both companies decided that to strategically compete in the pharmaceutical business, the manufacturing and marketing of these products needs to be combined under one ownership to remain competitive in today’s rapidly changing environment,” said Michael Doyle, Foremost Farms president and CEO. \n \nForemost Farms will invest the proceeds from the sale into other value-added whey protein products and businesses, Doyle said.  "}

Troubling countries for Cemex were Colombia and Egypt, but the multinational still delivered EBITDA of US$2.6bn in 2017. \n\nThe company also announced US$250m strategic capex spending for 2018, targetting assets in the emerging cement markets of Brazil and India . However, the company's subsequent decision this week to shelve its proposed capital increase , following consultation with its shareholders, would suggest that any immediate plans for expansion have been put on hold. \n \nNevertheless, the finances of the company have seen significant improvement and CFO, Jose Antonio Gonzalez, reported that cash interest payments had fallen from US$1423m in 2013 to US$821m in 2017, down by 42 per cent or US$600m. \n \nThree pillars for Cemex strategy \nThe forward strategy for Cemex was provided at Cemex Day 2018 by Juan Pablo San Agustín, EVP strategic Planning and New Business Development at Cemex. The three main pillars for the growth strategy are: leverage of the existing core network of cement aggregates and ready-mix, enabling of new digital technologies and entry into new markets. Cemex sees Brazil, India, eastern Europe, central and southeast Asia as main areas for future investment.  \n \nDomestic expansion \nIn the domestic cement market of Mexico, Cemex saw improved EBITDA, which increased 10 per cent YoY to US$1145m from US$1041m. In addition, the company noted a rise in cement prices per tonne by 16 per cent in 2017, exceeding the 15 per cent CAGR from 2014 to 2017. In terms of production, alternative fuel substitution has risen to 21 per cent in 2017 and kiln stoppages have fallen from 199 to 127 in the same period, while the clinker factor is now at 74 per cent. \n \nJuan Romero, Cemex Mexico President, pointed out that the main drivers for cement demand were the rise of the middle class, growing housing and industrial needs, structural reforms and strong US growth. While GDP in Mexico is forecast by Banxico to expand by 2.3 per cent in 2018, construction should also pick up by two per cent this year. \n \nCemex Mexico is currently responding to these market growth expectations by expanding its Tepeaca cement plant by 1.5Mta in a first upgrade phase, which should be completed in 2019. The Huichapan cement works will also have its cement capacity raised by 0.4Mta in 2018. \n \nUSA \nThe United States remains a core market for Cemex. EBITDA increased by nine per cent in 2017 to US$602m from US$555m the previous year and the company enjoyed improved price realisation (+5 per cent YoY) while it was able to limit cost rises to one per cent. \n \nLooking ahead, the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the strong residential outlook in Florida where YoY single-family starts are up by 12 per cent. California and Arizona offer opportunities in highway development, which is up six per cent YoY, while house reconstruction projects are expected to push the Texan residential new commercial builds up by four per cent in 2018. The forward trend for housing starts in Florida from 2017-22 is a CAGR of 10 per cent and highways and street cement demand in California for the same period is expected to expand by 11 per cent CAGR. Florida is forecast to lead US cement demand growth between 2017-22 with a CAGR of 7.9 per cent. \n \nCentral America and the Caribbean  \nThe 22 per cent YoY fall in EBITDA to US$477m in the company's Central America and Caribbean division was mainly accounted for by the decline in EBITDA in Colombia, where demand remained flat. However, the Caribbean delivered good returns as cement demand was robust in Guyana, Barbados, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Puerto Rico . In addition, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and Peru also delivered growth in demand. \n \nOn the production side, alternative fuels use is relatively low at 10 per cent, while clinker factor has reached 73 per cent in 2017. \n \nEurope \nCemex derives 48 per cent of its European revenues from the cement sector with a regional portfolio that supplied 11.1Mt of cement in 2017 up from 10.3Mta in 2016. Jaime Elizondo, President of Cemex Europe, pointed towards Spain as the significant growth market for the company as demand in the country is forecast to rise by more than five per cent between 2017-22. Housing is pushing cement demand up across all of Europe, buoyed by refugee flows. Cement prices have remained steady at US$73.60/t. \n \nIn terms of costs, some US$70m of savings were made through the use of alternative fuels. Poland leads thermal substitution rankings in the region with 77 per cent, followed by Latvia (73 per cent) and Germany (71 per cent), while Spain is still down at 33 per cent. \n \nAsia, Middle East and Africa \nJoaquín Estrada, President of Cemex Asia, Middle East and Africa, highlighted that 40 per cent of the divisions EBITDA came from its Philippines operations and 37 per cent from its Assiut Cement subsidiary in Egypt. The division supplied 10Mta of cement and although cement prices are stabilising in terms of local currency, Egypt's revenue has been hit by the devaluation. Pressure on prices in the Philippines continued. Average regional cement prices have fallen from US$84/t in 2016 to US$63/t in 2017. The Philippines has the highest kiln efficiency in Cemex at 94 per cent and further debottlenecking will improve efficiency. Around US$225m is being invested in the Solid Cement plant expansion, which is scheduled for completion in 1Q20. \nPublished under Cement News"}

{"articleID":33613872854,"title":"Dell EMC Launches 'Open' Virtual Networking Platform For VeloCloud, Silver Peak, Versa In Bid To Outflank Cisco In SD-WAN Market","content":"Dell EMC is doubling down on its commitment to open networking and intensifying its battle with Cisco Systems with the launch of a platform designed to work with SD-WAN solutions from not only with VMware's VeloCloud, but solutions from market powers Silver Peak and Versa Networks, as well. \n \nThe Dell EMC Virtual Edge Platform [VEP] is an x86-based, universal virtual networking CPE that Dell EMC executives say can be sold to enterprises adopting SD-WAN, and as a clear alternative to buying more expensive, proprietary Cisco routers. \n \n\"The way networking has grown-up is by monetizing the ASICs they've developed, and that's not this model,\" said Jeff Baher, Dell EMC senior director of product and technical marketing. \"That's why it becomes more challenging for existing suppliers. You don't have to ditch those [legacy] routers, but they're not going to be the routers you want to use for this. Keep it for the private wide area, and you can front-end it with this.\" \n \n[Related :  Cisco Rolls Out Viptela, Meraki-Based WAN Monitoring Solutions To Help Partners Capture Managed SD-WAN Opportunities ] \n \nDell EMC says the VEP 4600 is the first SD-WAN solution to use Intel's new Xeon D-2100 processor to connect the edge to the cloud via a CPE. Dell EMC has validated three SD-WAN solutions on the platform: VMware's VeloCloud, Silver Peak Systems and Versa Networks. \n \nBaher said the platform continues Dell EMC's drive to differentiate its open approach to networking from the proprietary approach taken by market leader Cisco Systems, even as the battle for dominance of the red-hot SD-WAN market intensifies. \n \nCisco acquired SD-WAN firm Viptela a little more than six months ago. Dell EMC's VMware business closed its acquisition of SD-WAN market leader VeloCloud last December. \n \n\"One approach says you can do it if you buy all of my stuff, all of my hardware and all of my software,\" Baher said. \"Ours is a little bit different. You're making investments at the infrastructure level independent from your software. You can stay within the Dell Technologies family for a long way, or you can decide at different points to disaggregate and introduce capabilities from the ecosystem. The battle for the enterprise is ultimately through a software lens, both in the way you see it and the way you program it. It's a software play, and the question is do you want that inextricably tied to the hardware, or do you want to have some ability to mix and match?\" \n \nThe VEP 4600 begins shipping in late April and is priced at $1,500 in the U.S. \n \nAn executive at a large solution provider that does business with both VMware and Cisco said it's difficult to determine clear-cut winners in the SD-WAN market, and this move by Dell EMC won't make it any easier. \n \n\"It's interesting that they're going to market with Silver Peak and Versa and VeloCloud,\" the executive said. \"As far as competitiveness with Viptela, each of those three flavors would have a different comparison. Viptela offers both physical and virtual approaches, and it has deeper routing capabilities. It benefits from the integration with Cisco's [branch] routers and [aggregation services] routers.\" \n \nThe executive said he considers Silver Peak the closest competitor to the Cisco/Viptela solution because of its strong WAN optimization capabilities. \"VeloCloud has historically focused more down-market, but we expect that to improve post-acquisition.\""}

{"articleID":33632392864,"title":"CANON : Weather Resistant Media for Aqueous Large-Format imagePROGRAF Printers is Now Available from Canon","content":"/PRwire/ -- In recognition of the importance of a long-lasting vibrant image, Canon U.S.A., Inc., a leader in digital imaging solutions, has announced two new media options for their imagePROGRAF Large-format printers: Canon Water Resistant Adhesive Matte Vinyl (330gsm) and Canon Water Resistant Matte Banner Vinyl (480gsm), both designed to withstand most weather elements for up to six months without lamination. Ideal for banners, posters and signage, these media types can find a home in a variety of different markets, including construction, beverage, education and retail. An exciting aspect of these new media types is their ability to be used in conjunction with aqueous imagePROGRAF printers, helping users produce bold colorful output for their outdoor displays. \"Many of our customers have a need for signs, posters or banners that can both be used outdoors and have the high quality look that one has come to expect from a pigment ink printer,\" said Toyotsugu Kuwamura, executive vice president and general manager, Business Imaging Solutions Group, Canon U.S.A., Inc. \"With this in mind, Canon has refined our media offerings to help protect what is most important: the image. With the combination of these media types and an imagePROGRAF aqueous pigment printer, the end result is a frame worthy print that can be hung outdoors. This is just the latest innovation from Canon to help the end-user get the most out of our products.\"\n\nAmong the key features of the new media types are:\n\nCreated for Aqueous Inkjet Lending themselves well to Canon Large-format printers that utilize aqueous inkjet technology, Canon's new media offers the ability to produce vibrant applications through environmentally friendly technology. With an expanded color range and durable quality, users will notice the ability to print color posters without the fumes and orders associated with Solvent ink technology – making it a logical fit for schools and education environments. \n\nIncreased Weather Resistance \n\nBoth new media types are designed to enable lasting image quality and resistance to fading that is commonly seen in outdoor applications. Tests conducted by Canon Inc. have shown that both types of media are capable of lasting up to six months of outdoor use without the need to laminate the output. When compared to regular media, the image has already faded and is almost non-existent by that point. Canon Built-in These new media offerings feature a unique durable ink-receiving layer that sits on top of the base material, helping to protect absorbed ink from running when exposed. This layer helps provide resistance to ultraviolet photo degradation – a critical component for outdoor applications exposed to prolonged periods of sunlight. Canon's water resistant media contains a binder with low water solubility over the base material to help protect the ink-receiving layer, which is not found in conventional media – in turn causing the ink-receiving layer to dissolve in water. \n\nImproved Adhesive Backing \n\nThe Water Resistant Adhesive Matte Vinyl (330gsm) features a peel away back to allow for easy application and repositioning. Air release grooves provides the ability to smooth out air bubbles when hanging directly onto a surface. This media type also features gray adhesive, helping prevent overlapping images when placed over a separate piece of media. The vinyl material easily conforms to curves and depressions, allowing for application on a variety of surfaces. \n\nImproved Banner Application \n\nCanon's Water Resistant Matte Banner Vinyl (480gsm) lends itself to outdoor banners, tapestries and long displays, featuring attached grommets for rope or wire hanging. A three layer base material, consisting of vinyl and polyester on top of another layer of vinyl, provides much needed durability when confronted with certain weather conditions, such as rain and wind. \n\nAvailability\n\nThe Canon Water Resistant Adhesive Matte Vinyl (330gsm) and Canon Water Resistant Matte Banner Vinyl (480gsm) are both available in 24, 36, and 42 inches. The Water Resistant Adhesive Matte Vinyl is also available in 54\" and the Water Resistant Matte Banner Vinyl in 60\".

Such double failure had ultimately led to the inactivation of auxiliary brake for stopping the escalator. The detailed investigation carried out by the EMSD revealed that Otis Elevator, being the maintenance contractor of the escalator concerned, failed to ensure the work were being carried out properly as stipulated in the relevant provisions under the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance and therefore, the EMSD decided to bring prosecution against the company.     The EMSD welcomed the Court's decision and will commence disciplinary action against Otis Elevator regarding the incident. The EMSD has also stepped up inspections for escalators with vertical rise equal to or exceeding 15 metres and issued a circular to all registered escalator contractors and registered escalator engineers, urging them to ensure the good operating conditions of the escalators in strict accordance with the Code of Practice for Lift Works and Escalator Works and prevent reoccurrence of similar incident. The EMSD will continue to strictly enforce relevant legislation and called on members of the trade and persons responsible for escalators to cooperate in ensuring safe and reliable escalator services to the public.     Section 47 (1) (a) of the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance stipulates that a registered escalator contractor who undertakes any escalator works must ensure that the works are carried out properly and safely.

The network's extension will bring fibre within reach of thousands more. \n \n  \n \nAccording to figures from industry body Fibre to the Home Council (2014), providing full fibre to just half of all premises could result in a 1.1% rise in annual GDP.

Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings of “aa-” of WestGUARD Insurance Company, AmGUARD Insurance Company, EastGUARD Insurance Company and NorGUARD Insurance Company, which operate under an intercompany pooling agreement. These companies are members of Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance (GUARD) and domiciled in Wilkes-Barre, PA. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. \n\nThe ratings reflect GUARD’s balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as strongest, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. \n\nGUARD’s solid risk-adjusted capitalization, favorable operating profitability achieved through disciplined underwriting initiatives and conservative reserving philosophy, which has resulted in favorable reserve development over the past 10 years, also were factors taken into account. The ratings also acknowledge the implicit and explicit financial support provided by GUARD’s immediate parent, National Indemnity Company (NICO), including significant reinsurance transactions. NICO is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire) [NYSE: BRK A and BRK B]. \n\nPartially offsetting these positive rating factors are the group’s above-average growth in its core workers’ compensation line and other commercial classes over the past several years. While profitable growth is welcome when it adds to surplus growth and business continuity – and GUARD has been deliberate and measured in its approach to the market – there is greater inherent risk associated with integrating new product lines and expansion into new states. In addition, there is a degree of risk as it regards the concentration in several states and production sources. Despite these concerns, the outlooks reflect GUARD’s enhanced financial flexibility provided by Berkshire, solid balance sheet and historical underwriting profitability. \n\nA.M. Best believes GUARD’s operating companies are well-positioned at the current rating level. However, these ratings or outlooks could come under pressure should softer market conditions and a lack of underwriting discipline in their new product lines and expansion initiatives result in a decline in underwriting and overall profitability to levels underperforming their peers, or should NICO fail to provide adequate financial and operational support, or should a sudden reduction in surplus emanate from investment portfolio losses given the large block of equity holdings. \n\nThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on A.M. Best’s website.

{"articleID":33474347343,"title":"After Cayan Deal, TSYS’s Buy — and Build — Integrated Payments Strategy","content":"In technology, and especially in payments, the competitive landscape is a heated one. \n \nThe question, when eyeing the competition and trying to stay ahead of the curve, usually boils down to “build or buy?” But sometimes the strategy can be tweaked a bit to “buy and build.” \n \nIn an interview with PYMNTS’ Karen Webster, Philip McHugh, EVP and president of  TSYS Merchant Solutions , laid out the strategy in a space — namely merchant services — that is rapidly evolving, and where TSYS has made a string of acquisitions to bolster its merchant-focused operations. \n \n“You go big, or you go home in this space,” he told Webster. \n \nBut the movement to scale, especially through an acquisition, has not been without its challenges, said McHugh, amid integration tasks and in interactions with analysts and others who all struggled to say what TSYS is really good at — and where it was going to make its mark as a payments provider for the merchant industry. \n \nTo that point, McHugh told Webster, “The primary goal is to be the number one payments provider to [small businesses (SMBs)] in the United States.” \n \nThe pushback from naysayers has focused on the competition — namely, for example, that First Data, Worldpay and Bank of America are bigger, and Square and Stripe are faster. \n \n“But we have the assets to do it. We have the scale to do it,” said McHugh of his company’s transformative plans, which are driven, in part, by focusing on software integration into the gateway, boarding new merchants and serving existing customers on the platform. \n \nHe noted TSYS is operating across a single settlement and back-end platform. \n \n“There are few players of scale that have sewn boarding and servicing together to make them really effective,” he told Webster. “Those platforms, plus being active in the consolidation of the market, can lead us to an exciting place on integration.” \n \nAs consolidation remains part of the roadmap moving forward, McHugh gave Webster a few pointers on what TSYS seeks in the market. When looking for firms to acquire, TSYS looks at, and will continue to look at, technology, ease of integration and verticals that remain untapped. \n \nThat combination, he said, is hard to replicate and hard to create from scratch. \n \nThese guiding principles were among the ones that led TSYS to Cayan . As was widely reported last year, TSYS acquired the payments solution company in a bid to boost its omnichannel offerings, striking a deal to buy Cayan for $1.05 billion in a transaction that closed in January of this year. \n \nCayan is the company behind Genius, a cloud-based platform that integrates payments processing, acceptance and tokenization services. \n \nSaid McHugh, “Cayan will integrate into TSYS just as much as TSYS will integrate into Cayan, both technically and culturally.” \n \nThe broad strategy here, he told Webster, is one where, admittedly, no gateway does it all. Stripe may be known for being the best in terms of ease of integration, while Adyen is known for its global coverage. \n \nBut with any gateway, he said, many questions must be answered. Among those questions: How easy is the technology to integrate for developers, and are application programming interfaces (APIs) easy to work with? Are the technology offerings broad enough to be deployed across in-store and online use cases? Is the tech stack robust enough to scale? \n \nMcHugh noted he’s focused on acquisitions where business development teams are already in place —and have a strong presence in verticals that can catch fire quickly. \n \n“It’s all about feature functionality,” he told Webster. “You build one or two things that really, really work for a vertical, and it takes off, [expanding] the use cases.” \n \nThe Cayan acquisition is helping TSYS boost efforts in retail, healthcare and in the salon and wellness verticals. \n \nBy way of illustration, he said TSYS has “a whole team, a large team, that specializes in health, and they can really talk to the needs of that industry … when you swipe your card at a doctor’s office, there may be four or five sub-merchants involved in a transaction.” \n \nComplexity — in a world where the lines between payment companies and independent software vendors (ISVs) are blurring — demands product development that understands the nuances and layers inherent in those transactions, he said. In the case of healthcare, McHugh said TSYS, with its integrated payments solutions, can address the complexity on the back end, while preserving the healthcare providers and consumer’s user experience. \n \nIf integrated payments are viewed as a wave of the future, opportunity lies in green fields for TSYS, as companies realize they need a strong technology partner that can provide payments services on their behalf — enabling payments without having to manage all the details. \n \n“We say that 30 percent of our direct business is integrated, which basically means we are selling to an ISV of some sort,” he told Webster. \n \nTwo years out, the company is likely to see a landscape where a larger percentage of its business will be a software solution and not a processing solution, said McHugh, even though he said TSYS has developed a platform that makes processing a core competence that delivers growth and margins. \n \n“We will have dedicated teams focused on integrated [payments] sales, either through a traditional model or payment facilitators model … what we want to do is make our integrated solutions, be it ProPay or Cayan … available to our partners through an ISV, ISO (independent sales organization) or FI.” \n Related Items: Acquisition , APIs , Cayan , Featured News , Genius , merchant solutions , News , payment technology , Philip McHugh , SMBs , Tsys   Recommended for you"}

This level of protection has never been available before and is the launching point for the future of Southwire’s Surge Guard surge protector product line. \n   \nCARROLLTON, Ga. (PRWEB)  March 20, 2018 \n \nSouthwire Company, LLC’s newest innovation, the Surge Guard® 50A Model 34950 , is an upgrade to the current RV line of surge protectors featuring patent pending technology to detect electrical issues within the RV. This feature furthers Southwire’s commitment to invest in the advancement of surge protector technology. \n \n“Our goal is to provide the highest level of electrical protection for RV owners to safeguard their families and investments from the dangers of electrical faults,” Southwire’s Director of Sales, Mobile Power & Electrical Safety, Bobby Raatz said. “Surge Guard Model 34950 includes exclusive technology that detects and protects against faults beyond the device. This level of protection has never been available before and is the launching point for the future of Southwire’s Surge Guard surge protector product line.” \n \nKey features of the Surge Guard 50A Model 34950: \n\n New patent pending technology allows the Surge Guard 50A Model 34950 to detect an open neutral condition inside the RV. The Surge Guard device can detect open neutral on the common neutral line from the device to the main breaker panel. When this fault occurs, there is a dramatic swing in the voltages in both Leg 1 and Leg 2, where one leg will swing to extremely high voltage and the other leg will swing to extremely low voltage, causing immediate damage to all electronic devices that are plugged in inside the RV, unless the Surge Guard 50A Model 34950 is in use.  Both the Surge Guard 30A Model 34930 and Surge Guard 50A Model 34950 can now detect and protect against elevated ground line currents that are generated inside of the RV.  All Surge Guard RV power protection devices, including the Surge Guard 50A Model 34950, include a Limited Lifetime Warranty with Connected Equipment Coverage, effective on aftermarket Surge Guard products retail purchased on or after 11/27/17.   \nAbout Southwire: \nA leader in technology and innovation, Southwire Company , LLC is one of North America’s largest wire and cable producers.

The research house estimated its annual\n\ncapacity is around 0.43mn kilo litres and sales volume for Heineken was around 0.23mn kilo\n\nlitres in 2017. The main brands it operates in China are Heineken, Tiger, Anchor, and\n\nSkol. For the premium brand Heineken beer, we estimate it has a market share of 4% in the\n\npremium segment. Overall market share for Heineken China is 0.5%.\n\nNomura said the reported consideration implies an EV/EBITDA of 18x, which looks\n\nreasonable compared to recent M&A valuation of 15-21x and CRB's current valuation of 17x\n\nFY2018 EV/EBITDA.\n\nIt believes the biggest upside for CRB could be the acceleration of its premium beer\n\nsales with the help of Heineken's strong brand equity. While it is hard to estimate the\n\nfinancial impact for CRB at the current stage, Nomura highlighted that a 1% volume shift\n\nfrom the mainstream segment to the premium segment would increase its FY2018 EBITDA by\n\n3.4% and FY2018 net profit by 5%.\n\nIt reiterated its \"buy\" rating on CRB with a target price of HK$37.

Academic medical centers are no exception, and one in particular, Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, has built its own proprietary predictive analytics framework — which it says has not only improved costs but has boosted its star ratings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \n \nOver the past eight months or so, Rush has embarked on a project to harness big data, whereby information from electronic health records and other systems can go into what Chief Analytics Officer Bala Hota, MD, calls a “single source of truth” — essentially a data lake.  \n \nUsing Microsoft Azure in a cloud environment, with a security layer on top, Rush has been able to quickly expand the capability of its cluster. And computing power isn’t an issue. \n \n[Also:  Missouri collaboration gathers ZIP code-level data for pop health efforts ] \n \nHospitals and academic medical centers might look to Rush as proof of the advantages when it comes to developing their own proprietary technologies to bend back costs and boost revenues. \n \n“The advantage of the approach is we can use big data technologies to apply machine learning models to the data, and predict features about the data,” said Hota. “We’ve focused a lot on chronic diseases because we see an opportunity from a population health perspective to improve outcomes, bend the cost curve and achieve the best quality documentation for our patients.” \n \nUnder this new data philosophy, the medical center was able to better grasp what it was already doing well in terms of documenting. It now has a set of dashboards in its analytics that show the level of documentation and comorbidity in its patients, and show how sick they are, as well as opportunities to fill any gaps in documentation. By group and by service line, it has opened the door to improved accuracy. \n \n[Also:  Future-proofing population health: Embrace predictive analytics, social determinants and patient-generated data now ] \n \nIt has also alleviated physician burnout, said Hota, because physicians don’t always truly know what should and shouldn’t be documented, and what constitutes accuracy for an individual patient. This approach essentially takes that work out of their hands. \n \nIn terms of cost, Rush has been able to build surgical programs, combined with enhanced recovery-after-surgery programs, and has developed a number of dashboards that can answer questions about how a given population is doing: Are they following their care pathways? Have there been any deviations? How does that impact potential cost? \n \nThe results have yielded positive results, but perhaps none more public than boosting its CMS rating to five stars. With healthcare becoming more consumer-oriented — and patients increasingly spending their dollars on highly-rated institutions — star ratings matter. \n \n[Also:  Microsoft rolls out cloud-based tools just ahead of HIMSS18 ] \n \n“We tried to look at the nuts and bolts of the way the star ranking is done,” said Hota. “We were interested in the methodology. We looked at CMS, and we looked at the observed rate of events — and we’ve done a lot of interventions to reduce the rate of adverse events — and we also looked at the expected rate, or the risk-adjusted rate.”  \n \nWhat Hota and the team found is the ability to strengthen risk adjustment by essentially pinpointing inaccurate data that was hurting the Medicare ranking and improving clinical documentation to avoid it continuing to happen.  \n \n“There’s a philosophical approach,” he said. “The data shows that academic centers struggle in terms of accuracy for risk adjustment. When you look at the star rating, there’s a bias where academic centers have below-average star rankings. Our sense is that because trainees are doing a lot of the documenting, there’s less emphasis on accuracy.” \n \nRush’s clinical documentation improvement tool was enabled partly by the academic institution’s access to software developers; it is currently looking at ways to potentially commercialize the technology.  \n \n“We’ve really only scratched the surface. The advances that are taking place in the machine learning space are incredible,” Hota said. “This is a complete paradigm shift and an incredible amount of information we’re seeing in a short period of time, compared to traditional statistical methods. We’re trying to be understanding of the information, allowing it to guide our analytics.” \n \nTwitter: @JELagasse \nEmail the writer: jeff.lagasse@himssmedia.com \n \nThe post appeared first on Mattheneus HTA ."}

Vero bought shares at an average entry price of 91 cents a share including via participation in Tower's deeply discounted rights issue at 42 cents a piece. It was offering $1.40 a share in its failed takeover attempt. \n\n​Vero today said it sold its shares to Bain Capital at 80 cents a share, amounting to $53.9 million in total. Tower's NZX-listed shares closed at 78 cents yesterday and were up 3.9 percent at 81 cents today. \n\n\"Total losses amount to $7.5 million which was within our risk appetite given the compelling nature of the transaction to acquire 100 percent of Tower and the value creation it would have achieved,\" a spokesman said in an emailed statement. \n\nSuncorp New Zealand recognised a $12 million loss on the value of its Tower stake when reporting its first-half results last month, and today's sale is at a premium to that, meaning it will register an $8.5 million gain on the sale.

{"articleID":33597792007,"title":"Risky Business: Majority of HR and Payroll ...","content":"Survey by The Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated Finds Overburdened Departments Cut Corners to Get the Job Done \n\nA survey from The Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated finds that more than half of human resources (HR) and payroll professionals (55 percent) have witnessed compliance activities by their colleagues that created unnecessary risk. \n\nThe Risky Business Survey is a survey of 812 HR and payroll professionals in the U.S. conducted in partnership with Future Workplace. The survey examines how a lack of time and resources creates a perpetual struggle with compliance that organizations of all sizes face every day. \n\nNews Facts \n\nUnder pressure: Organizations of all sizes create unnecessary risk to get the job done efficiently According to the survey, 66 percent of payroll professionals and 51 percent of HR practitioners say their organization occasionally cuts corners that may jeopardize compliance, including more than two-thirds (69 percent) of all respondents whose systems are more than five years old. More employees create more challenges: large organizations (2,500-9,999 employees) are the biggest offenders, as more than two-thirds (68 percent) of respondents say they have seen colleagues cut corners when it comes to compliance. No one is immune to temptation: 58 percent of organizations with 1,000-2,499 employees, 56 percent of organizations with 500-999 employees, and half of organizations with fewer than 500 employees all report taking shortcuts that may jeopardize compliance. Too much work, too little time: HR and payroll departments could use an extra set of hands to manage compliance The survey finds that, on average, HR and payroll departments spend approximately 36 hours per week on compliance-related activities ranging from tracking regulatory proposals to creating and communicating new policies – enough work for a dedicated full-time employee! Organizations with fewer than 500 employees average 23 hours per week on compliance duties, while those with 500-999 employees average 31 hours per week. It increases to 36 hours per week for organizations with 1,000-2,499 employees. There is a direct link between technology investment and time spent on compliance: organizations utilizing newer solutions spend nearly ten fewer hours per week on compliance (34 hours per week with a solution 1-5 years old versus 43 hours per week with solutions 5+ years old.) Critically important, constantly time-consuming: Compliance is a necessity that costs both time and money With a single major regulatory change often costing businesses between $40,000 and $100,000, HR and payroll professionals have a long list of priorities they would tackle if they could spend less time and money on compliance, including: Improving overall payroll efficiency (22 percent); Increasing manager effectiveness (13 percent); More employee/internal communications (11 percent); Organizational strategy (10 percent); and Better performance management (nine percent). Nearly half (47 percent) of survey respondents say maintaining multiple, duplicate employee records leads to increased compliance risk. The survey found organizations maintain an average of five separate records per employee and dedicate 32 hours per week on manual, duplicate data entry. About three-quarters of survey participants (74 percent) agree that cloud solutions are best suited to support today’s continually changing compliance landscape. Supporting Quotes \n\nJoyce Maroney, executive director, The Workforce Institute at Kronos\n\n“HR and payroll professionals are among the most thoughtful, passionate, and meticulous professionals within any organization. They don’t cut corners because they’re careless: usually it’s because they’re overburdened, understaffed, or lack the proper resources required to handle anything above and beyond the day-to-day activities required to run the department. Organizations that ensure their HR and payroll teams have access to modern solutions will be able to strike a better balance between time-consuming compliance requirements and the strategic activities needed to build a highly engaged workforce.” Malysa O’Connor, senior director, HR and payroll practice group, Kronos\n\n“Many HR practitioners and payroll professionals feel like regulations are changing at the speed of light. They’re working hard to keep pace but the technology that they’re surrounded with is often outdated or doesn’t provide the agility and efficiency needed to adapt to changing laws. HR, payroll, and timekeeping in a single cloud solution will simplify the time and resources required to keep up with regulatory change while also ensuring that company policies are applied fairly and consistently across the entire workforce.” Dan Schawbel, partner and research director, Future Workplace; New York Times best-selling author, Promote Yourself\n\n“New policy changes can be a significant burden for companies of all sizes. They can create stress, consume productivity and force HR to take shortcuts that end up costing organizations even more money in the future.” Supporting Resources \n\nNote to editors: Please refer to this research as “The Risky Business survey” by The Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated and Future Workplace.

For this survey, 812 HR and payroll leaders were asked about their views regarding regulatory compliance. The study targeted leaders with HR and payroll responsibilities who work across different sectors and in organizations of different sizes. Respondents are recruited through a number of mechanisms, via different sources to join the panels and participate in market research surveys. All panelists passed a double opt-in process and completed on average 300 profiling data points prior to taking part in surveys. Respondents were invited to take part via email and were provided with a small monetary incentive by Morar Consulting for doing so. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. In this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than three percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.

This year, 19 out of 20 keynote speakers will be men. \n \nJustin Sullivan/ \n \nAt a major cybersecurity event in April, the only woman out of 20 keynote speakers is a social commentator.  \n \nHer name is Monica Lewinsky, and she advocates to prevent cyberbullying. \n \nThe other 19 keynote speakers and moderators, who will present during the four-day RSA Conference in San Francisco, are men. Of those men, all but one are cybersecurity experts. \n \nThe lineup has frustrated people in the cybersecurity field, with Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, taking to Twitter to criticize the conference organizers for leaving women out of RSA’s top speaking roles. He even suggested he’d host an alternate conference nearby with a host of women experts, at which his role would be to hand out popcorn . \n \nMaybe it’s time to rent out the Metreon again for an alt-conference, this time all women speakers (with me handing out popcorn). Anybody game? \n \n— Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) February 27, 2018 \n \nLewinsky said on Twitter that she found out about the all-male lineup this week, and told USA Today in a statement that she’s asked organizers to do better. “I’m disappointed by this oversight but RSA has about six weeks until the conference, so I’m optimistic that the matter will be rectified by then,” she said. \n \nRSA Conference vice president and curator Sandra Toms said in an interview that the lineup is not finalized and more women could join the list of keynote speakers before the event begins. US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has been formally invited, for example, but isn’t yet confirmed to speak. Other invitations to women keynote speakers are still pending, Toms said. \n \n“We strive each year for a diverse speaking panel,” Toms said.  \n \nThe dustup reflects a persistent problem in tech that happens to be even worse in cybersecurity. Women work in just 11 percent of jobs in this field ( PDF ). That’s bad because security companies say they can’t hire skilled people fast enough. Alienating women with the potential to excel at cybersecurity could make us all less safe, especially as hackers continually hammer computer networks to steal our sensitive information. \n \nIt also comes as tech conferences continue to take heat for gender bias. In January, organizers of CES, a giant consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas, took criticism for excluding women from their slate of speakers, too. And in 2016 at Defcon, a major hacking conference in Las Vegas, women complained of a hostile atmosphere that left them feeling unwelcome.  \n \nWho’s responsible? \n \nBut who exactly is to blame for the lack of women at tech conferences and in cybersecurity jobs around the world? Well, nobody is raising a hand to take sole responsibility for that one. \n \nPau Barrena/ \n \nToms said the lack of diversity overall in cybersecurity makes it hard to find women for the conference. “We acknowledge that there is a lack of women in cybersecurity and it’s part of a larger lack of diversity in the larger tech space.”  \n \nSo, it’s the fault of the tech industry at large that RSA organizers couldn’t fill any of those roles with women cybersecurity and tech experts. While that could sound like a dodge, it’s not not  true — just look at the companies sponsoring the event.  \n \nAfter all, that’s where most of the keynote speakers come from, including companies like Microsoft, Symantec and McAfee, plus RSA Security, a cybersecurity company owned by Dell that sponsors the conference but isn’t the same entity that organizes the event.

Over eight episodes the players will be followed from their preparation for draft night through Summer League competition, training camp, and the regular season. The series is produced for ESPN by Winik Media and 441 productions, and will be exclusive to streaming service ESPN Plus. \n \n“It will be really compelling, access-based programming, bringing fans closer to their favorite athletes, telling the story of the journey of adjusting to life in the NBA on the court and off the court,” said Connor Schell, executive vice president of content for ESPN. “I love being able to do storytelling like that and have it be at people’s fingertips.” \n \nThe series is the first for ESPN Plus to get an official greenlight publicly from the sports-media giant, though several more are in the works. Kobe Bryant last week in an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” discussed his new series, “Detail,” which will also be an ESPN Plus exclusive. \n \nESPN Plus is set to launch this spring with a subscription price of $4.99 per month.

The demo is scheduled for 29 March, 2018, at 2 PM EDT, and registration is required. Netwrix Auditor – Data Discovery and Classification Edition was developed in partnership with Concept Searching, the global leader in semantic metadata generation. The solution will enable complete visibility into where sensitive files are located, what content is inside them, who can access the files and who actually uses them. \n\nThe new edition will help organizations prove the effectiveness of their data security controls as required by GDPR and other regulations by enabling them to: \n\nGain a high-level view of the sensitive data they store Discover any sensitive data stored outside of a secure dedicated location Streamline regular attestations of access rights to sensitive data Detect unauthorized activity around sensitive data \n\nNetwrix Auditor is a visibility platform for user behavior analysis and risk mitigation that enables control over changes, configurations and access in hybrid IT environments to protect data regardless of its location. The platform provides security intelligence to identify security holes, detect anomalies in user behavior and investigate threat patterns in time to prevent real damage.\n\n\"The new edition of Netwrix Auditor, developed in partnership with Concept Searching, will help organizations address critical GDPR requirements, relieve the compliance burden and ensure the security of business-critical data. Analysts say that only 30% of organizations worldwide are fully compliant with the new law, and that most are taking a piecemeal approach to adopting GDPR controls. We offer a more holistic approach to GDPR compliance and empower companies to provide hard evidence that sensitive files are not overexposed, that they reside only in dedicated safe locations with proper access controls and that they are not accessed by unauthorized personnel,\" said Michael Fimin, CEO and Co-Founder of Netwrix. \n\n\"Organizations often have siloed content, due to geography or function, and lack visibility into the presence of privacy and sensitive information. The new edition of Netwrix Auditor, combined with Concept Searching's ability to generate semantic multi-term metadata, delivers unprecedented insight into where vulnerabilities exist, mitigating enterprise risk, averting exposures, and ensuring all legal and regulatory compliance requirements are met. The solution offers proactive governance dictated by actions, and builds trust and transparency through the uncompromising protection of personal data in the organizational community,\" commented Martin Garland, President of Concept Searching.\n\nNetwrix Auditor – Data Discovery and Classification Edition is scheduled for general release on 12 April 2018.

{"articleID":33521555287,"title":"Regents plan a new veterinary building for West Texas A&M’s Agricultural Sciences complex","content":"The Texas A&M University System Regents today announced plans for a $22.8 million building for veterinary education, research and workforce opportunities in the Panhandle as part of almost $90 million in new commitments to the state agriculture industry on the West Texas A&M University campus. \n \nIn a special telephonic meeting Thursday morning, the Board of Regents added the Texas A&M University’s new Veterinary Education, Research & Outreach (VERO) Center to its Capital Plan. The VERO Center will be constructed adjacent to West Texas A&M University’s new Agricultural Sciences Complex and a new Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) facility currently in the process of relocating from Amarillo to Canyon. \n \n “This is a great day for Texas A&M, West Texas A&M and the Panhandle,” said Chancellor John Sharp. “With these three new facilities in Canyon, the Texas A&M System has invested nearly $90 million in the future of agriculture and animal health in this region. We have created a two-way superhighway of veterinary education and research activity from Canyon to College Station, and it runs right through these new structures.” \n \nOnce the VERO Center is completed in 2020, it will provide an anchor in Canyon where students from Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (CVM) will be able to take courses, participate in externship programs and conduct research. Opportunities for research and collaboration with faculty and staff at TVMDL, West Texas A&M’s Agricultural Sciences Complex and the CVM’s VERO Center will be available to students from both Texas A&M and West Texas A&M. \n \n“This arrangement is a perfect model of how, through collaboration with the System’s regional universities and state agencies, we can expand our reach and our impact on the lives of Texans,” said Texas A&M President Michael Young. \n \n“When we first announced this partnership, we indicated that we wanted to increase enrollment of promising future veterinarians from the Panhandle area at the CVM, knowing that they were more likely to return and work in this area following graduation,” said West Texas A&M President Walter Wendler. “By bringing the College of Veterinary Medicine to WT, those students won’t have to wait until after they graduate to come home and begin making a difference.” \n \nThursday’s announcement is the latest development in a nine-year effort on the part of the CVM to expand veterinary education, research and undergraduate outreach throughout the state. \n \nIn 2009, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board encouraged the veterinary school to increase its enrollment to meet future state needs. With no state appropriation available for construction during the recession, Texas A&M invested $120 million from the Permanent University Fund to construct a new teaching complex, which opened in 2016. That same year, in anticipation of their expanded capacity for enrollment, the CVM announced partnerships with four System institutions – West Texas A&M, Tarleton State University, Prairie View A&M University and Texas A&M University-Kingsville – designed to encourage more underrepresented minorities and rural students to pursue veterinary education. \n \nAn initial focus was placed on the partnership with West Texas A&M because of its location in the epicenter of the U.S. livestock industry. The CVM established the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Center at WTAMU in 2016 and hired Dr. Dee Griffin and Dr. Dan Posey, two experienced veterinary professionals, to build a program to address regional industry needs and enhance interest among students. Evidence of success materialized quickly. In 2017, West Texas A&M University’s College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences set a school record of 10 graduating pre-veterinary majors who were accepted into veterinary schools. Nine of the 10 went to Texas A&M. \n \n“We are thrilled by the rapid return in our investment in West Texas A&M and ecstatic to be establishing a permanent presence on their campus,” said Dr. Eleanor M. Green, the Carl B. King Dean of Texas A&M’s CVM.  “The Texas Panhandle leads the nation in livestock production, so it is vital that we continue to provide this region with exceptional graduates and quality service as only Texas A&M can. Our success here will also inform our approach with the three other partnerships that make up our statewide, system-wide initiative.”"}

The losses are estimated to be as much as an average of $ 1.39million per organisation, per year! The organisations in question employed 8,000 people on average. Whilst your own organisation may be smaller or bigger, the correlation holds true, downtime = real financial losses. \n  \nThis finding is not a surprise, research has consistently shown the downtime is expensive. This being the case you would expect that most organisations would choose to be more vigilant in having better protection and availability. Surprisingly it remains the case that many companies do not take the most expedient steps to protect their data or build recovery plans that make use of the most up to date technology. \n \nThe problem is that data protection is not valued in the same way as data analytics. Company executives can draw a line between revenue and data analysis technologies. They need to connect the dots between downtime and losses. It could be argued that not doing so, it is a gross mismanagement of funds which in the very worst cases can end in a companies demise. \n \nVeeam With Hewlett Packard \n \nWithout over stating the case, data protection and availability today can mean the difference between a company’s success, failure or even continuation.

Telecom operators Vodafone India and Idea Cellular today announced the leadership team for their soon-to-be-merged entity, with Kumar Mangalam Birla as the non-executive Chairman and Balesh Sharma as the new CEO. The merger – slated to create India’s largest telecom operator in terms of customer base and revenue market share – is expected to be completed by June this year, subject to statutory approvals.\n\nSharma, currently the Chief Operating Officer of Vodafone India, in his new role as the CEO of the combined entity will be responsible for driving the business’ strategy and its execution. He will also oversee the integration of the merged entity that is slated to be worth over $23 billion with a 35 per cent market share. The leadership announcement comes a year after the two companies had said they will join forces to operate in the hyper-competitive Indian mobile telephony market.\n\nThe merger – which is set to dislodge the numero uno player Bharti Airtel – was imminent as the incumbent operators have been bruised by aggressive tariffs from newcomer Reliance Jio, which triggered a price war in the industry. The existing leadership teams of Idea Cellular and Vodafone India will continue to manage their separate businesses until the merger becomes effective, Idea said in the regulatory filing.\n\n“Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla would be the non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors of the merged company,” the statement said announcing the composition of the new team that includes over a dozen key executives from the two telecom giants. It is only upon completion that the two businesses will cease to operate as distinct and competing entities, the statement added. The changes will come into effect up to merger of Vodafone’s Indian telecom entities with Idea Cellular and be subject to all requisite approvals, it added.\n\nIdea Cellular’s CFO Akshaya Moondra will head the financial operations of the new entity as its CFO. Ambrish Jain (currently the deputy MD at Idea Cellular) is set to become the new COO. “The Aditya Birla Group intends to nominate Himanshu Kapania (currently Idea Cellular MD) as non-executive Board member of the merged entity, with a significant assignment in the Group post-merger,” the filing said.\n\nSunil Sood (Vodafone India CEO) will join the Vodafone Group AMAP (Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific) Leadership team and also help governance through Board memberships, Idea filing said. Manish Dawar, who was recently roped in as the CFO of Vodafone India, will get the overall responsibility for integration planning, governance and execution at the merged entity.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App"}

A total of 1,034 hand dryers will be installed. \n \nRelated:  Winds of Change \n \nHand dryers in restrooms will be the new campus standard for buildings moving forward.

The project will start in the Humanities and Social Sciences Building, McClung Tower, Student Services Building, and Communications Building. \n \nRelated:  Paper Trail \n \nOnce hand dryers are installed and functional in restrooms, the paper towel dispensers will be removed. \n \nThe university says the hand dryers will help reduce waste; paper towels make up more of campus waste than any other single item. Hand dryers also will reduce the amount of labor required to clean and maintain restrooms, reduce transportation for deliveries of paper towels, save trash can liners, which are the most costly custodial supply item on campus, and prevent litter and overflowing trash cans in restrooms. \n \n“We are excited about this opportunity to save material, labor, and disposal costs and keep campus cleaner and greener,” says Recycling Manager Jay Price. “This will help campus get a lot closer to zero waste.”"}

The already announced administration of its UK business will continue, the company said. \n \nNew Jersey-based Toys ‘R’ Us was already in the process of closing one fifth of its stores as part of an attempt to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a speciality retailer. \n \nEfforts collapsed this month after lenders decided, absent a clear reorganisation plan, they could recover more in a liquidation, closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \n  \nThe disappearance of Toys ‘R’ Us leaves a void for hundreds of toy makers that relied on the chain as a top customer alongside WalMart Inc and Target Corp. \n \nShares of Mattel and Hasbro tumbled last week on Toys ‘R’ Us’ liquidation reports. Both rely on Toys ‘R’ Us for roughly 10 per cent of their revenues, according to their 2016 annual reports. - Reuters"}

This guide will share some of the recent developments in the channel and the latest thoughts about the issue. \n Start Download        \nGDPR took centre stage at a recent event run by Ricoh UK, with the vendor using a platform to highlight the challenges faced by partners and customers. \n \n“No vendor or supplier can guarantee GDPR compliance, and that responsibility starts and rests with each organisation,\" said Mike Irvine, vice president and general manager for software and European programme management at Ricoh . \n \n“Ricoh uses the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability) principles of privacy and security in every product and service we develop. These principles are very important to all organisations when they are deciding how to improve the security of their information systems,\" he added. \n \nThe other complication has been the moves by some vendors to provide channel partners with a GDPR solution that appears to solve all of the customer problems. \n \nBill Forest, IT Director at M2 , said that the Ricoh event challenged that view and should encourage managed print specialists to look at what they were delivering to customers. \n \n“It’s important to remember whilst IT vendors and suppliers can organisations improve their GDPR health, no one product or service will categorically make you GDPR compliant,\" he said. \n \nThere have been some concerns that multifunction devices might store data that could be compromised and become a weak link with others in the industry sounding warnings in recent weeks. \n \n“As well as considering data breaches, organisations also need to reflect on the personal identifiable information of individuals present in their enterprise systems, such as a company’s print/copy/scan infrastructure, and how to comply with individuals’ rights concerning that data,” says Martin De Martini, Co-founder and CIO at Y Soft . \n \n“Looking at the typical enterprise workflow solutions management setup, which includes network printing, scanning, copying and managing physical access to MFDs, there are a number of obligations related to the providing organisation under GDPR. This includes the likes of the processing of personal data by enterprise workflow solutions being secure and having all personal data that is processed by any of the services identified, amongst other obligations,\" he added."}
{"articleID":33542516952,"title":"Vbrick® Brings HTML5 Multicast Distribution to its Rev® Enterprise Video Platform","content":"Vbrick today unveiled its next-generation enterprise video distribution strategy with new HTML5 multicast capability, another seamlessly integrated component of its Rev enterprise video platform. \n \nThe new service uses HTML5 to play a single, encrypted, high-quality live video stream that is efficiently multicast across edge servers comprising the Rev enterprise Content Delivery Network (eCDN optimized local caching). The service is a bandwidth efficient alternative to using Flash or peer-to-peer HTTP Live Streaming (HLS agents) which send masses of unicast streams to individuals, draining available bandwidth on corporate wide area networks. \n \nUnlike other offerings on the market, which require customers to manually configure servers, Vbrick has taken a ‘zero configuration’ approach; enabling users to practically “check a box” in Rev to enable HTML5 multicasting across their organizations. \n \nRev uniquely offers this user-friendly approach using its own, centrally managed first-party eCDN to efficiently deliver live and recorded video at the network’s edge, where it’s closest to end users. The Rev eCDN includes the Rev video management platform, Vbrick Distributed Media Engines (DME) - media caching, storage and streaming nodes, and Vbrick's own Mesh architecture - which enables peer-to-peer nodal communication between DMEs. Similar to commercial content delivery networks, Vbrick’s Mesh architecture allows for DMEs to self-discover one another to create a shared global cache, without requiring point-to-point configuration among nodes. \n \nThe new HTML5 multicast service uses all the same automated and advanced distribution capabilities of the Rev eCDN, giving customers automated deployment, centralized management and advanced video WAN optimization capabilities. Through the Mesh interconnected DMEs, live streams and on-demand videos are automatically shared, distributed, cached, and WAN accelerated. For video-on-demand, the eCDN’s optimized local caching increases playback to increase playback quality while reducing external and internal bandwidth demands. \n \nThe service also will support Rev’s advanced, dual-stream video conferencing streaming and recording output to allow end users to customize their viewing experience, enlarging video or content windows as desired. \n \nVbrick showcased the new capability at booth #1936 at Enterprise Connect. The service currently available to beta customers is expected to be commercially available for Rev customers by Spring 2018. \n \n“Our customers championed the importance of multicast as the best solution for efficiently delivering live video across their networks,” said Shelly Heiden, CEO of Vbrick. “As the recognized leaders in video distribution technology, we were able to design a simple and efficient solution that would meet their needs and give the assurance of video delivery across browsers, devices and OS’ for the foreseeable future,” Heiden said. \n \nAbout Vbrick \n \nVbrick believes in the power of video to transform the workplace. Its Rev enterprise video platform removes the technology and pricing restraints that have held business back from tapping video’s clear advantage to persuade, inform and compel people, wherever they are.

{"articleID":33902652466,"title":"","content":"Assistant Professor Prerna Singh will use her award for research that compares how India and China approach combat contagious disease at the national level. \n \nPROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — The Carnegie Corporation of New York has awarded Brown faculty member Prerna Singh one of 31 2018 Andrew Carnegie fellowships for a project titled \"The Control of Contagion: States, Societies and Infectious Disease Across China and India.\"   \n \nSingh, an assistant professor of political science and international and public affairs, and a faculty fellow at Brown's Watson Institute, will compare the differences in the success rates of interventions against disease across and within China and India. \n \nThe Andrew Carnegie fellowships are informally known as the \"brainy awards,\" and each fellow receives up to $200,000 toward the funding of significant research and writing in the social sciences and humanities. Proposals are selected, according to the Carnegie Corporation, based on high-caliber scholarship that applies fresh perspectives to some of the most pressing issues of our times, shows potential for meaningful impact on a field of study and has the capacity for dissemination to a broad audience. \n \nIn her project, Singh will undertake a comparative historical analysis of why some countries respond more effectively to public health crises than others, looking in particular at the responses of the Chinese and Indian states to infectious diseases. This builds on prior research into variations in institutions of social welfare and development outcomes. Her award-winning book, \"How Solidarity Works for Welfare: Subnationalism and Social Development in India,\" explored why some places develop more inclusive welfare regimes and deliver better social outcomes than others, and argued that the power of collective identity can spur nations to prioritize social welfare. \n \nIn total, the Carnegie Corporation awarded $6.2 million in support to the 31 winners, whose research proposals focus on a broad variety of complex political, economic, technological, humanistic and sociological matters. \n \n\"We were reassured by the immense talent and breadth of experience reflected in the proposals from this year's nominees for the Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program,\" said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York and president emeritus of Brown University. \"The response to the fellows program gives me great hope for the future of the study of the humanities and the social sciences as a way for this country to learn from the past, understand the present, and devise paths to progress and peace.\" \n \nSingh also landed recent honors from the American Academy in Berlin as a 2018-19 Berlin Prize fellow. Her semester-long fellowship will be spent in residence at the academy's Hans Arnhold Center in Berlin-Wannsee, Germany. Singh will explore why polities with similar epidemiological, socioeconomic and demographic conditions have been characterized by strikingly different levels of effectiveness in countering equivalently severe challenges posed by a disease. \n \nWatson Institute Director Edward Steinfeld said the two awards to Singh illustrate the impact and relevance of the research that she and other scholars at Brown conduct. \n \n\"Both prizes speak to the excellence of Prerna's research and to its engagement with the most pressing social issues of our time,\" Steinfeld said. \"What a wonderful celebration of an individual scholar and the broader academic community of which she is an indispensable part.\""}

{"articleID":33687110455,"title":"Banner warns of 'negative findings' from data breach probe","content":"Patients or other customers who have questions or concerns about the cyberattack can call 1-855-223-4412. \n    \nBanner Health anticipates “negative findings” from an ongoing federal probe of a 2016 cyberattack that exposed the records of nearly 3.7 million patients, employees and others. \n \nThe Phoenix-based health provider disclosed in its 2017 annual report that a U.S. Health and Human Services’ Office of Civil Rights’ investigation has included queries about the health provider’s security assessments. \n \n“The OCR investigation is still active, and the OCR has indicated that the initial Banner responses with respect to its past security assessment activities are inadequate,” Banner said in its recently released 2017 financial report. \n \nBanner, Arizona's largest health provider and among the nation's largest nonprofit health systems, said it provided more answers to federal investigators but “anticipates that it may receive negative findings with respect to its information technology security program,” that could include a fine. \n \nBanner was the target of a massive June 2016 attack when hackers gained access to the health provider's food and beverage payment systems and quickly moved to other servers that contained individuals' medical and personal information. In all, the attack compromised records of nearly 3.7 million patients, employees, health insurance customers and others. It's the largest such attack involving a health-related entity over the past two years, according to OCR records. \n \nBanner, which also faces a class-action lawsuit over the data breach , said it could not estimate possible fines from the federal agency. \n \nIn February, OCR fined dialysis provider Fresenius Medical Care $3.5 million for 2012 data breaches at five locations, including Fresenius Medical Care Ak-Chin in Maricopa. The Maricopa location failed to “implement policies and procedures to address security incidents,” OCR said in a statement. \n \nIn a statement provided to the Arizona Republic , Banner Health said it is fully cooperating with the OCR investigation and has made changes to information technology security issues identified following the data breach.  \n \nBanner Health said the changes included upgrades to comply with payment card industry data security standards, monitor cyber threats and risks and implement secure practices. \n \nOther changes involved areas of program governance, identity and access management and network and infrastructure security, Banner Health said. \n \nBanner also has offered ongoing credit monitoring for individuals affected by the data breach.  \n Banner faces lawsuit over data breach     \nA summer cyberattack on Banner Health was followed by civil lawsuits from a doctor and several patients alleging harm. \n    \nBanner’s larger financial exposure could come from a prospective class-action lawsuit making its way through U.S. District Court in Phoenix. \n \nU.S. District Judge Susan Bolton rejected parts of the lawsuit in a December ruling but found enough merit to allow claims of unjust enrichment, negligence and violations of the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act to move forward.  \n \nThe plaintiffs, including a ophthalmologist at two of Banner's West Valley hospitals, a Banner employee and four Arizona and Colorado patients, updated their lawsuit in January to include additional claims against the health provider.  \n \nThe lawsuit alleges that Banner Health could have prevented the data breach but \"failed to take a number of fundamental, industry-standard steps to ensure adequate information security — and apparently did so to enhance its own bottom line profitability.\" \n \nPrior to the attack, the lawsuit alleges that Banner did not follow industry precautions such as safeguarding key systems behind firewalls, encrypting sensitive data, monitoring compliance and segregating networks to prevent hackers from moving freely within Banner's computer systems. \n \n\"From the very outset, we were surprised those types of systems were not segregated and walled off,\" said Paul Stoller, a Gallagher & Kennedy attorney representing the plaintiffs. \n \nBanner attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs updated claims.  \n \nThe lawsuit alleges that hackers gained access to names, birth dates, addresses, social security numbers, provider information and medical histories with the goal of making money. A Banner forensic examiner identified the culprit as a criminal organization, likely with the goal of making money off of the information. \n \nThe lawsuit alleges that some individuals whose information was pilfered already have been victims of fraud attempts, though the lawsuit did not provide details. \n \nIn addition to federal oversight, Arizona is considering bolstering oversight of data breaches under a bill backed by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich.  \n \nHouse Bill 2154, which is advancing in the Arizona Legislature, would require earlier announcements when hacking occurs. The bill still requires final votes in the House and the Senate. \n \n "}

The area is also within historic jaguar habitat,” according to the statement announcing the lawsuit. \n\nA federal judge in California last month rejected arguments from the state of California and a coalition of environmental groups that sued the Department of Homeland Security violated the constitution with the waiver. But Judge Gonzalo Curiel found the federal government had wide discretion when it came to border security but declined to rule on claims that did not involve the constitution."}

(Photo by AFP) \n \nThe US Air Force is likely to slash its purchases of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jets to save money, a new study has revealed, a new threat to the costly program’s sustainability. \n \nAfter complaining about the costly stealth aircraft’s delayed and problematic development, the USAF is now worried that the massive orders it has placed for the F-35 might hinder modernization and maintenance of its current fleet. \n \nTo do this, the USAF might be forced to cut the overall purchase by 38 percent, reducing the program’s working project of 1,763 jets by nearly one third, or 590 aircraft, Bloomberg reported, citing an internal USAF study. \n \nToday, at least 270 F-35s are being operated by the USAF as well as the US Navy and the Marine Corps. \n \nLast year, after immense pressure by President Donald Trump to drive down costs, the US Department of Defense and Lockheed agreed on costs of $94.6 million for the F-35A, the conventional takeoff and landing variant used by the USAF; $122.8 million for the F-35B, the USMC’s short takeoff and landing variant; and $121.8 million for the F-35C, the US Navy variant designed for takeoff and landing on aircraft carriers. \n \nThe USAF must foot an annual bill of around $3.8 billion to operate the warplanes. Recently, the Pentagon revealed that it would need about $16 billion to maintain and upgrade the F-35 jets it has already purchased and deployed through 2024. \n \n\"It’s premature for the Air Force to consider buying fewer aircraft at this time,” Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanik told Bloomberg. \n \nCommonly referred to as the world’s most expensive weapon, the F-35 project has been dogged by technical problems and software issues. The program has been in progress over the past 17 years, missing its original development targets by over a decade. \n \nFollowing a decision by Congress, the F-35 program is scheduled to deliver 90 new jets this year, 20 more than what was initially planned. The peak production rate would reach 160 new jets per year by 2023, according to reports."}

Getty images\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) has extended and expanded its wide-ranging partnership with YouTube TV.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Google-owned streaming service will continue to serve as the presenting sponsor of the 2018 and 2019 editions of the season-ending World Series.\n\nMLB will continue to promote YouTube TV during the best-of-seven game series, with the service’s branding to be featured across MLB’s digital and social platforms and in stadiums, while YouTube TV will use MLB stars in its own advertising through a variety of national TV spots.In addition, the service will see its brand promoted during the first pitches of games on MLB’s sports channel, MLB Network, as well as the league’s streaming service MLB.tv, and amplified across its digital platforms and social media channels.\n\nThe new deal will also see YouTube TV expand its baseball offering through the addition of MLB Network, while its members will also be able to watch MLB.tv for an additional fee.\n\nYouTube TV first agreed a deal with MLB in October 2017, which marked its first major advertising partnership and saw the platform serve as MLB’s first-ever presenting sponsor of its World Series events. The deal aimed to drive digital consumption of World Series coverage whilst also raising awareness of YouTube TV.

{"articleID":33680398132,"title":"Case study: cutting food waste in the supply chain","content":"Compass Group Australia partners with charity organisations and works closely with suppliers to make good use of surplus food \n \nWhen you’ve catered for 1,000 guests at a corporate dinner and only 800 turn up, you’re left with ingredients for 200 meals that are at risk of going to waste. That’s one of the reasons why contract catering firm Compass Group Australia has partnered with non-profit OzHarvest to distribute surplus food to foodbanks and charities. \n \nThe cost of food waste is estimated at $20bn a year in Australia, and in 2016 the government developed a national food waste strategy that aims to halve the amount of waste by 2030. \n \n“We are the largest food service provider in Australia. We purchase about 50,000 tonnes of fresh food a year,” says Andrew Brightmore, executive director of supply chain. Part of the global Compass Group, the Australian division supplies to many industries, from fine dining for five star restaurants, to corporate events, schools, prisons and remote offshore locations. “An organisation this size has to take the mantle in leading in lots of areas, especially in social responsibility,” says Brightmore. \n \nThe supply chain team initiated the partnership with OzHarvest, explains Brightmore. “We set ourselves a target of finding out what we can we do on top of existing programmes to truly drive sustainability and CSR across our business.” \n \nThe focus on sustainability is a core business strategy for the brand. It has developed awareness campaigns and training for staff in operating environments to encourage waste reduction, and menus are designed to minimise waste. Brightmore explains: “The whole operation is constantly monitored to keep it lean, efficient and flexible.” \n \nCompass has created its own software and tools so kitchen staff on site can weigh and record ingredients used and number of meals created, and the central team can log in and see what is surplus. \n \nThe partner sites contact OzHarvest whenever there is suitable food waste to be collected. The charity, which operates mainly in cities, takes as much food as possible, and reports back to Compass on what has been collected and how many meals have been distributed. This helps Compass improve food ordering and menu planning. \n \nThe partnership started in February last year, launching to the firm’s strategic suppliers. “The supply base embraced it quickly,” Brightmore says. \n \nIn remote locations, Compass encourages waste reduction on site and uses innovative composters to cut out long distance shipping of waste. \n \nCribbing with care \n \nIn remote Australian mining communities, Compass has been running a campaign to encourage employees to use sustainable alternatives to their plastic lunch containers (cribs). “We want to raise awareness of the need to reduce waste,” says Brightmore. “And we hope that they will take the message back home too. We want to change the dynamic so that we reduce the need to recycle plastic packaging.” \n \nWhile raising awareness within the communities, Compass is also working with industry to find the best biodegradable solutions, and there are plenty of innovative companies working on ideas, he says. “There is a whole breadth and depth of alternatives on the horizon.” "}
{"articleID":33577798868,"title":"»   German Plant Expansions: Evonik plans new PA12 complex in Marl; Lanxess increases capacity for engineering plastics in Krefeld-Uerdingen","content":"Chemicals firm Evonik is planning to build a new production complex for polyamide 12 (PA 12) in Marl, Germany, to increase capacity by more than 50%. After successful basic engineering, Evonik says it plans to invest approximately EUR400 million in the PA 12 complex at its largest site, Marl Chemical Park in North Rhine-Westphalia. The existing PA 12 production is to be supplemented with additional manufacturing facilities for the polymer and its precursors. The complex is expected to become operational in early 2021. \n\nThe investment will make a substantial contribution to reaching Evonik’s margin goal and will generate an annual cash flow in a three-digit million Euro amount over the long term. The project is to be implemented over the course of four years as part of the annual budget for growth investments, says the German firm. \n \n“We are planning Evonik’s largest investment in Germany,” says Christian Kullmann, Chairman of the Evonik Executive Board. “This investment is a perfect fit to our strategy of consistent focus on specialty chemicals since polyamide 12, as a high-performance polymer for speciality applications.” \n \nThe PA 12 market is posting annual growth rates exceeding 5% worldwide, significantly outpacing the global gross domestic product. In the speciality application of 3D printing, growth rates even reach double digits. “The demand for polyamide 12 is showing steady, dynamic growth,\" says Claus Rettig, Chairman of the Board of Management of Evonik Resource Efficiency GmbH. “The planned capacity expansion will further strengthen our leading market position for polyamide 12. For our customers worldwide, our commitment translates into long-term availability and reliability of supply for their existing and future applications.” \n \nPA12 is used in many demanding applications as a replacement for steel: in automotive and lightweight design as well as in oil and gas pipelines and Evonik says it is also very well positioned for the future production of hybrid and electric vehicles as well as the medical sector and 3D printing. \n \nMeanwhile, in other news, speciality chemicals company Lanxess says it has now commissioned a new production line for the manufacture of speciality compounds at its Krefeld-Uerdingen site in Germany. The German company has invested approximately EUR7 million in expanding the production capacities of its engineering plastics. Lanxess says it is thus expanding its position as one of the world’s leading suppliers and developers of high-performance compounds based on polyamide 6, polyamide 66 and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). \n \nThe new line has an annual capacity of up to 10,000 tonnes. At the Krefeld-Uerdingen site, it complements the compounding lines designed for the production of Durethan polyamide compounds and PBT compounds of the Pocan brand. \n \n“With this investment, we are responding in particular to the development of new forms of mobility such as electromobility, but also to trends in the electrical and electronic industry such as the Industry 4.0, which are leading to a growing demand for complex thermoplastic compounds,” explains Michael Zobel, Head of Lanxess’s High Performance Materials business unit. \n \nThe new production line includes a high-performance twin-screw extruder with a modern raw material feeding, precise dosing and an efficient cooling and classifying technology. “The extruder provides all the equipment necessary for the economical production of high-quality compounds,” explains Stefanie Nickel, Head of Compounding in the High Performance Materials business unit. “The line is very well suited, for example, for our glass fibre-reinforced polyamides, which are used in the structural lightweight design of automobiles.” \n \nIt is also suitable for the production of compounds with high mineral content, which are used in thermally conductive housing parts, for example for the miniaturisation of electronic assemblies. “We also see great potential in flame-retardant compounds, for example for components in electric drives,“ Nickel continues. \n \nIn addition to its German sites in Krefeld-Uerdingen and Hamm-Uentrop, Lanxess operates compounding lines in all relevant economic regions worldwide to supply its international customers – for example in Wuxi, China, in Jhagadia, India, in Gastonia, US, and in Porto Feliz, Brazil. \n \nIn 2019, Lanxess will open another compounding plant in Changzhou, China, with a capacity of around 25,000 tonnes/year. With its world scale production facilities in Krefeld-Uerdingen and Antwerp, the speciality chemicals group is one of the world’s largest producers of polyamide 6 base resins. \n \nSubscribe to Get the Latest Updates from IMA   Please click here \n (IMA)"}

So, the brand wanted to be able to harness the data available through its loyalty program to provide personalized marketing campaigns that present customers with the right offer at the right time. \n \nThe restaurant plans to enhance and grow the program with personalized offers and coupons that will be available in an online wallet. “We can reward customers with items we know they love, but also encourage trial on other menu items, while protecting franchisee profitability by keeping the redemption window fairly limited,” says Cassidy. \n \nHe says the restaurant chain recognizes the competitive nature of the loyalty space. Considering that the average consumer has three to four loyalty cards on them at all times, it wanted to make its program quick and easy for customers. “It is different from other frequency-based programs like Domino’s because it requires one less purchase to unlock the reward – five versus six.” \n \nThe program aims to acquire new customers and drive frequency with those who visit less often, while encouraging loyal patrons from going elsewhere. Cassidy says the brand is trying to reach a broad audience of value-conscious people who order online and pick-up in-store. \n \nThe restaurant is promoting the program through a 10-week Facebook campaign and will air a TV spot in May. \n \nThe program has picked up 40,000 members since it launched on March 12.

{"articleID":33524879401,"title":"Justice Department, AT&T-Time Warner Outline Strategies in Pre-Trial Briefs","content":"WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice plans to argue that AT&T ’s proposed merger with Time Warner will pose harms to competition, including that the merger company will have the incentive to coordinate with Comcast to withhold content from nascent online rivals. \n\nThe line of argument was featured in a pre-trial brief filed late Friday, and immediately rebutted by AT&T - Time Warner in its own brief. \n \nThe Justice Department is seeking to block the transaction, arguing that the merger of the combined company would lead to higher prices for consumers. \n \nIn its brief, the DOJ’s Antitrust Division said that “unlike an independent Time Warner, the merged firm would share with Comcast a strong interest in slowing or blocking disruptive new entry by virtual MVPDs. The firms could advance this shared interest by withholding from Virtual MVPDs Turner and NBC content—two of the most important network groups for Virtual MVPDs— or restricting their use of that content (e.g., by prohibiting inclusion of channels in skinny bundles).” \n \n“Because market conditions are conducive to coordination, and because a coordinated denial of content to virtual MVPDs would face relatively few obstacles, the merger likely would facilitate coordination and lead to higher prices, fewer options, and reduced innovation.” \n Related   \nAT&T-Time Warner, however, said  such an argument does not make sense because they “want growth in these services, because more online video viewership increases usage of its wireless broadband network, where AT&T has a decided market advantage over Comcast.” \n \n“AT&T has more than 100 million wireless connections in the U.S.; Comcast has almost no wireless customers (380,000 by its own account),” AT&T-Time Warner said in its brief. “Consumers who watch video on AT&T mobile devices will benefit the merged firm even if they use an over-the-top provider other than DirecTV Now: they will increase their use of AT&T’s broadband network; they will expand the number of devices to which AT&T can send targeted advertising, the most valuable form of advertising in the industry; and they will become less likely to switch (‘churn’) to other wireless providers.” \n \nThe trial briefs suggested that the parties will make heavy use of expert witnesses and data, while also calling corporate executives and rivals. Witness lists are expected to be made public next week. \n \nMuch of the focus of the DOJ’s argument has been on the ability of AT&T-Time Warner to withhold or drive up the price of Turner Networks to other distributors, with the cost increases ultimately passed on to consumers. \n \n“For current consumers of traditional pay-TV content, economic modeling shows that the merger will mean paying for the equivalent of 13 months of Turner content per year, while getting only 12. That’s pure overcharge consumers will have to pay without getting anything in return,” the DOJ says in its brief. \n \nAT&T-Time Warner, however, plans to poke holes in the government’s economic model and one of its expert witnesses, Carl Shapiro of University of California Berkeley. \n \n“To the contrary, the government now concedes it would not be profitable for the new company to withhold its television networks from pay-TV distributors and that the new company’s prices to its own television customers will go down,” the companies say in their brief. “As a result, the government’s suit to block this merger is not only baseless in fact, but it is affirmatively contrary to consumer welfare, making it difficult for the government even to allege a viable antitrust claim, much less prove one.” \n \nOther arguments outlined in the briefs: \n \nHBO. The DOJ argues that the merged company “will far less inclined to allow rivals to use HBO to win subscribers from DirecTV, as AT&T would have a strong preference that subscribers access HBO content via DirecTV. It likely would act on these changed incentives immediately.” \n \nAT&T-Time Warner, however, says that the “evidence will show that the government has it exactly backwards: it is HBO that needs its distributors to promote its programming—not vice versa—and nothing in this merger will affect those fundamental business imperatives.” \n \nMore to come…"}

The reasons for the company's collapse: mismanagement, crippling debt, e-commerce and changing shopping habits, just to name three factors. \n\nHere's a brief look at what led to the demise of Toys \"R\" Us, along with some niggling issues affecting customers and workers at the 735-store chain.\n\nDebt company walking\n\nToys \"R\" Us fell prey to a crushing debt load of $5 billion stemming from its 2005 leveraged buyout by private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR (KKR), and real estate investor Vornado Realty Trust (VNO). The deal was ill-timed, saddling the retailer with loans as shoppers were shifting their spending from big-box stores that defined the previous era in retail to the internet.\n\nThe company's current leadership only compounded its mistakes by failing to act quickly and decisively. One example: When Toys \"R\" Us first declared bankruptcy in September, CEO Dave Brandon vowed not to close any stores, blithely remarking that \"today marks the dawn of a new era at Toys \"R\" Us.\" He was wrong. \n\nAmazon effect\n\nToys \"R\" Us lost market to rivals, including Amazon (AMZN), in recent years.\n\n\"Toys are particularly vulnerable to the Amazon effect because Amazon thrives with products that are known and you can buy in lots of places,\" said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of digital marketing and consulting firm Huge. \"Therefore people will buy just buy (them) wherever it's cheapest and the most convenient.\" Michelle Steinberg, Founder of domain Integrated, a branding firm, also said Toys \"R\" Us had trouble attracting employees, as Walmart (WMT) and other retailers raised wages.\n\nLet the pink slips fly\n\nRoughly 33,000 Toys \"R\" Us workers in the U.S. could ultimately lose their jobs because of the company's liquidation. That would be the most retail industry layoffs since Circuit City shut down in 2009, which cost 34,000 jobs and which ranks as the 11th on Challenger's all-time ratings.\n\nAccording to data from Challenger, Grey & Christmas, which tracks layoffs, Challenger, Grey has tracked job cuts announcements since 1993. Circuit \n\nThe largest retail sector layoff since 2015 happened in 2016 when Walmart shuttered 269 stores and laid off 25,000, the firm says.\n\nPuny parachute\n\nToys \"R\" Us is offering salaried and hourly employees the equivalent of 60 days in pay and benefits. That's more than many employees get when companies fail. \"[T]here is no fixed rule that says, 'Thou shalt pay severance' in a total liquidation,\" said Stephen Selbst, chair of the restructuring and bankruptcy practice at law firm Herrick, Feinstein, which specializes in retail industry bankruptcies. \n\nIf it makes rank-and-file workers at the company feel better, top executives are unlikely to get bonuses, he added.\n\nIs my gift card still good? \n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, D-New York, on Thursday asked the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that Toys \"R\" Us honors its unused gift cards. The retailer is continuing to honor them for the next 30 days along with rewards points. \n\nStill, it's not clear how long that will remain the case. \"As a legal matter, Toys isn't required to honor those gift cars,\" Selbst said. \"If I had a gift card, I would use it as quickly as I could. Don't let it gather dust.\"\n\nWorld of hurt\n\nThe bankruptcy filing doesn't cover Toys \"R\" Us' international business, but it's struggling, too. The company's U.K. business on Wednesday announced that it is closing its doors after failing to find a buyer -- about 3,000 people will lose their jobs. Toys \"R\" Us is considering combining as many as 200 of its top-performing U.S. stores with its Canadian operations, but Selbst said that would be complicated, expressing doubt it will fly. \n\n-- With reporting by Aimee Picchi"}

{"articleID":33523623225,"title":"WHAT'S IN STORE: Aldi, Starbucks underway in Nokomis","content":"Retail Reporter @maggiemenderski  \nEven before the new Aldi sprung up from the ground, you could feel change in the Nokomis area. \n \nConstruction has boomed on U.S. 41. on the quiet mile and a half stretch that starts just north of Laurel Road and runs just to the south of Albee Road. \n \nThere’s a Hilton Home2 Suites there now that wasn’t there a year ago, and construction on a Wawa is underway. \n \nStarbuck’s has hammered a coming soon sign in front of a few other commercial shells that are still waiting for their first tenants, and even though Aldi, a discount grocery store, hasn’t announced its grand opening yet, it’s already put green “welcome” decals on the front doors. \n \nMeanwhile land has been cleared and commercial building permits for utilities have been filed for another retail development just across the street. \n \nIt’s an area that’s overslept quite a bit when you compare it to what’s happened in Sarasota and even Venice. \n \nNow it’s in for a wake-up call. \n \nFor decades regional and national players have overlooked the Nokomis and Osprey areas because they lack the density that some of their neighbors have, Steven Larkin, a retail expert with Michael Saunders and Co., told me.  \n \nBut as developers have consumed virtually all the green space and opportunities to build in this disposable income lush-area have dwindled, retail players are taking a gambled they wouldn’t normally take. \n \nThe density may not meet their typical criteria, Larkin told me, but the traffic counts do and that's what they're betting on.  \n \nThe people who run up and down U.S. 41 every day are going to continue to do so, he said. Between that and the overwhelming uptick in population and tourism growth that we’ve seen, most retailers are desperate for a piece of Southwest Florida. \n \nEven if it’s not what’s traditionally been considered the prime pieces in town. \n \nIt’s all prime at this point, and while those of us who live here understand the different personalities that come with each section of U.S. 41, to outsiders it’s all Sarasota. \n \nWe may not be all that far off from a time when Sarasota and Venice are melded into one, said Barry Seidel, president of American Property Group of Sarasota Inc. \n \nNokomis and Osprey, which have long been the bridge between the two, are in the middle of an evolution. \n \nThere are at least five quick service restaurants that are in the works out that way, Larkin said. Rooftops are expanding out past Interstate 75, Seidel added, and the planned hospital to the east on Laurel Road is sure to be a draw to the community. \n \n“That whole Nokomis area is starting to rise up,” Seidel told me. \n \nTo outsiders it's looking more and more like a place to be than a bridge. \n \nAnd whether these small communities are ready for that wake-up call or not, the ongoing development could be much more than a new hotel, grocery store, gas station and Starbucks. \n \nIt could be a whole new identity. \n \nMaggie Menderski, the Herald-Tribune’s retail and tourism reporter, can be reached at 941-361-4951 or maggie.menderski@heraldtribune.com.

{"articleID":33481028504,"title":"LTE security flaws could be used for spying, spreading chaos","content":"Enlarge  / Bugs in some carriers’ 4G LTE implementations and flaws in parts of the standard could make anyone nationwide a target for hacks and surveillance. T-Link Wireless  \nThere have been lots of reasons to be concerned about how easily someone with the right tools and knowledge could do very bad things with cellular communications networks. And while none of them has necessarily been to the level of some of the fictional stunts pulled off on television (see Mr. Robot ), new research shows that things are even worse than they appear—and in many cases, that’s because of how carriers have implemented cellular standards. \n \nAs ZDNet’s Zack Whittaker reports, researchers at Purdue University and the University of Iowa conducting tests of 4G LTE networks have uncovered 10 new types of attacks. They made this discovery as part of their evaluation of a proof-of-concept 4G LTE penetration testing toolset, called LTEInspector . Combined with nine previously-known attack methods that Syed Hussain, Omar Chowdhury, Shagufta Mehnaz, and Elisa Bertino also identified as still being usable against many carrier networks, the collection of exploits could be used to track device owners, eavesdrop on texts and other sensitive data, and even pose as them on cellular networks and spoof location and other data. An attacker could even spoof warning messages like those used by government agencies and weather services—such as the false missile warning sent out by a Hawaii government employee. \n \nThe security of 4G LTE networks is largely based on obscurity—many of the implementations are proprietary “black boxes,” as the Purdue and Iowa researchers put it, which makes performing true security evaluations difficult. And because of the large range of sub-components that must be configured, along with the need to be able to handle devices configured primarily for another carrier, there is a lot of slush in LTE implementations and not a lot of transparency about network security. Recent IEEE-published research found that implementations of the “control plane” for various LTE networks varied widely—problems found on one network didn’t occur on others. \n \nAnd that variation is true of security as well. In one case, the Purdue and Iowa researchers found that a carrier didn’t encrypt “control plane” messages at all, meaning an attacker could even eavesdrop on SMS messages and other sensitive data. That flaw that has since been fixed by the carrier. \n \nWhile 4G LTE provides for a level of privacy for cellular customers through the use of ephemeral “subscriber identities” over the air, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology recently found that the Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI) issued by a majority of 4G LTE carriers was far from temporary. While carriers do change the GUTI for phones periodically, the KAIS researchers found that 19 of the 28 carriers they surveyed did so in a very predictable way—making it easy to predict not only when a new ID would be assigned, but also what most of the new GUTI would be, because much of it went unchanged. \n \n“In our global-scale measurement analysis, we did not find a single carrier that implemented GUTI reallocation securely,” the KAIS researchers wrote. A similar problem exists in 3G GSM networks’ temporary subscriber IDs. \n \nThe exploits discovered by the Purdue/Iowa team go beyond simple location tracking. One exploit allows tracking of a target by just using a phone number, sending a phone call while simultaneously blocking call notification by hijacking the target’s paging network connection. Another attack allows a malicious device to pose as the target device through an “authentication relay” attack before sending its own location data and other messages to distort carrier location data logs. \n \nThe paging network, which also carries SMS and other messages, can be hijacked for other purposes: to send messages to the network posing as the target, to inject fake emergency alert messages, quietly kick the victim off the cellular network, or to conduct denial-of-service and power depletion attacks against the victim. \n \nAll of these tricks are on top of other well-known attacks currently leveraged by “IMSI catchers” such as the controversial Stingray hardware used by law enforcement agencies. And that’s not to mention the various location-tracking techniques that exploit smartphones’ Wi-Fi  or chatty mobile applications ."}

(March 16, 2018) — The American Red Cross will join the Boston Red Sox and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to honor lucky presenting donors with an incredible experience – the chance to become the Blood Donor of the Game!  Red Sox fans are invited to enter to win simply by stepping up to the plate and donating blood to help patients in need. \n \nAll presenting donors at American Red Cross blood drives or donation centers in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont will have the opportunity to enter for the chance to become Blood Donor of the Game from now through the end of the 2018 Boston Red Sox regular baseball season. In addition to winning two tickets to a game at historic Fenway Park, the Blood Donor of the Game will be presented with a commemorative souvenir and will have the chance to take part in a special on-field experience prior to the start of the game. \n \nThe Blood Donor of the Game program is a unique way for the Red Cross to thank volunteer blood donors during the spring and the upcoming summer months, often a challenging time for the Red Cross to collect blood donations. \n \n“Our patients and our clinicians who care for them thank the blood donors for their commitment to improving the quality of care and life of many,” said Lynne Uhl, M.D., Vice Chair for Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  “Blood donation does save lives.” \n \n“The Boston Red Sox are proud to support the Red Cross through the Blood Donor of the Game and our other programs,” said Sheri Rosenberg, Manager of Alumni and Player Relations, the Boston Red Sox. “The Red Sox believe in giving back to our community and supporting our fans throughout New England. We encourage our fans to present to donate blood with the Red Cross and have a chance to step foot on the Fenway Park grass and become the Blood Donor of the Game!” \n \nIn addition to game tickets and the chance for a special on-field honor, winners will also be presented with a commemorative souvenir. \n \n“The Red Cross is thrilled to be able to offer this opportunity to our dedicated blood donors in New England,” said Donna M.

All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients. A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements. \n \nBlood and platelet donors can save time at their next donation by using RapidPass ® to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online, on the day of their donation, before arriving at the blood drive.

However, the site's current zoning plan, which was sanctioned as a consulate and not as an embassy, does not permit such changes to be made. \n \nThis week, though, Israeli construction authorities have recommended that the paving of a escape route leading from the building take place without the required three-year permit. \n \nIsraeli finance minister Moshe Kahlon applauded the move. In a recent statement, Kahlon wrote, \"As we have promised, we will not let redundant bureaucracy delay the transfer of the American embassy to Jerusalem, Israel's eternal capital. This is a strategic and political move for Israel,\" he added, the Jerusalem Online reported. \n \nLast week, Kahlon tweeted at US President Donald Trump, whose announcement of the embassy move in December caused such uproar: \"I'm happy to inform you that we are moving forward with the preparations, making sure that no bureaucracy slows down the process of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.\" \n \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also promised to cut through any red tape holding up the move. \"The prime minister will act decisively and quickly to ensure that the American embassy will move at the planned time and he will not allow unnecessary bureaucracy to harm the process,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement released last week. \n \nLast month, Netanyahu invited Trump to Jerusalem for the scheduled ribbon-cutting embassy ceremony in May, in time for Israel's independence day, May 14."}

The opportunity to get this bounty is available to all members of the famous HackerOne platform, Kaspersky Lab’s partner for the Bug Bounty initiative. This is a 20-fold increase on existing rewards, and is evidence of the company’s commitment to ensuring the complete integrity of its products and protection for customers. \n\nThe top reward is available for the discovery of bugs that enable remote code execution via the product database update channel, with the launch of malware code taking place silently from the user in the product’s high privilege process and being able to survive the reboot of the system. Vulnerabilities allowing other types of remote code execution will be awarded bounties ranging from $5000 to $20000 (depending on the level of complexity of a given vulnerability). Bugs allowing local privilege escalation, or leading to sensitive data disclosure will also be awarded bounty payouts.   \n\nRewards are available for the discovery of previously unknown vulnerabilities in the following products: Kaspersky Internet Security 2019 (https://goo.gl/UbkohE) (the most recent beta) and Kaspersky Endpoint Security 11 (https://goo.gl/Z9xCjL) (the most recent beta), running on Desktop Windows version 8.1 or higher, with the most recent updates installed.  \n\nFurther details of requirements and eligibility are available here (https://Hackerone.com/kaspersky). \n\nCommenting on the increase in the bug bounty rewards, Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said “Finding and fixing bugs is a priority for us as a software company. We invite security researchers to make sure there are no vulnerabilities in our products. The immunity of our code and highest levels of protection that we offer customers is a core principal of our business – and a fundamental pillar of our Global Transparency Initiative.” \n\nThe company’s bug bounty program, launched in 2016, encourages independent security researchers to supplement the company’s own work in vulnerability detection and mitigation. The program has already led to more than 70 bug reports related to Kaspersky Lab products and services being resolved and thus making them even more secure. \n\nThe company’s Global Transparency Initiative (https://goo.gl/kvrRcE) announced on 23rd October 2017 is designed to engage the broader information security community and other stakeholders in validating and verifying Kaspersky Lab’s products, internal processes, and business operations, as well as introducing additional accountability mechanisms by which the company can further demonstrate that it addresses any security issues promptly and thoroughly. \n\nRelated Articles \n\nKaspersky Lab helps uncover vulnerabilities that make gas stations easy prey for hackers \n\nFortune Favors the Bold: Future-Proofing Your Career \n\nSerbia Exits $1.32 Billion Three-Year Program with IMF \n\nStartupbootcamp Opens Application to Source Top Startup Talent Across the Globe \n\nWorld’s Best Performing Macro Hedge Fund Lost 16% Last Month \n\nAPO Group unveils world-first print monitoring for press releases distribution in Africa"}

{"articleID":33790668017,"title":"","content":"WASHINGTON, DC – As part of the U.S. Department of Labor’s ongoing efforts to encourage occupational licensing reform, the Department today announced $7.5 million in funds to help review and streamline occupational licensing rules. Funds will be available to states, and associations of states, to review, eliminate and reform licensing requirements, and to promote portability of state licenses. Additionally, grant funding will be available to post-secondary institutions and occupational licensing partners to address barriers to licensure for veterans and transitioning service members. \n \n“Excessive licensing raises the cost of entry, often prohibitively, for many careers, barring many Americans from good, family-sustaining jobs. In 1950, only 1 in 20 jobs required an occupational license. Today, more than 1 in 4 require a license to work,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta. “These grants are part of the Department of Labor’s efforts to eliminate and streamline excessive licensing requirements. If licenses are unnecessary, eliminate them. If they are necessary for health and safety, then streamline them and work with other states for reciprocity.” \n \nGrant Funds for States to Review and Streamline Licensing Requirements: \n \nIndividual states may apply for between $100,000 and $450,000 for a three-year grant. An existing association of states can apply for up to $1 million for a three-year grant.  The Department intends to make funding available for up to 20 states, and may also fund one to two associations of states.  \n \nSuccessful applicants will objectively analyze the relevant licensing criteria, potential portability issues, and whether licensing requirements are overly broad or burdensome. Importantly, applicants should provide specific plans of action designed to reduce excessive licensing. Applicants are also encouraged to consider the potential of alternative approaches to licensing that would be adequate to protect public health and safety (such as professional certification). \n \nGrant Funds to Address Licensure Challenges for Veterans and Transitioning Service Members: \n \nTo address barriers to licensure for veterans and transitioning service members, applicants for funded projects will select one or more licensed occupations, and conduct academic credit and gap analyses between military education and training in selected licensed occupations. Based on these analyses, grantees will develop bridge training curricula customized to close those gaps to enable veterans to qualify for state licensure in the selected occupation. Each awardee will identify and address licensing requirements in high-demand occupation areas such as transportation, healthcare, protective service, and mechanical/construction occupations.Successful applicants will support the development and wide dissemination of appropriate accelerated educational and licensing programs. \n \nFor additional information on grant eligibility and how to apply for funds, visit http://www.grants.gov ."}

{"articleID":33656626763,"title":"GenOn Selling More Assets in Restructuring","content":"GenOn Energy, a unit of NRG Energy that filed for bankruptcy in June 2017, said it has agreed to sell two units of the Canal Generating Plant to Stonepeak Kestrel, a subsidiary of Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm with offices in New York City and Houston, Texas. \n \nThe Canal plant in Sandwich, Massachusetts, named after the Cape Cod Canal, was a coal-fired facility when it came online in 1968. Today it operates on natural gas and petroleum fuel. The $390.3 million deal announced March 23 is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. The two units have combined generating capacity of 1,112 MW. \n \nGenOn, formed in 2010 after the merger of RRI Energy and Mirant, was bought by NRG in 2012 in a $1.7 billion deal. The company as part of its reorganization has been divesting assets, and in February agreed to sell its 810-MW gas-fired combined cycle Hunterstown plant in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to Platinum Equity, a private equity firm in Beverly Hills, California, for $520 million. Platinum Equity in a release said it wanted to acquire add-on opportunities for the plant. \n \n“The power-generation industry continues to experience some dislocation, which is fueling corporate carve-out activity,” Louis Samson, a Platinum Equity partner, said in a news release. “Hunterstown is well maintained and features industry-leading technology. It operates in PJM, the largest electricity market in the United States, and generates strong recurring revenue streams.” \n \nGenOn also is retiring assets. The company in late February told the California Public Utilities Commission and California Independent System Operator that it will close three gas-fired plants near Los Angeles: Etiwanda Generating Station Units 3 and 4 on June 1, 2018; Ormond Beach Generating Station Units 1 and 2 on October 1, 2018; and Ellwood Generating Station on January 1, 2019. \n \nGenOn in a statement announcing the Canal and Hunterstown deals said it “estimates the realization of $910.3 million of gross cash proceeds, $886 million of which is expected by early in the third quarter of 2018, with an additional $24.3 million of post-closing excess fuel inventory payments within the next two years.” The company also said it “continues to make significant additional progress in exploring and evaluating value-maximizing alternatives for its various remaining interests.” \n \nHowever, GenOn said it will not seek any more bids for the 1.14-GW Bowline power plant in Haverstraw, New York, and it expects to retain ownership. The company said the facility is undervalued, with the highest bid received for the plant at $240 million. The company in its statement said it plans to “undertake operational and capital structure initiatives to maximize [the plant’s] profitability and cash flow.” \n \nReports at the time of GenOn’s bankruptcy filing said the company’s restructuring plan would eliminate $1.83 billion in GenOn Energy debt, along with $695 million from GenOn Americas Generation. Filings also showed the plan involves NRG ceding all equity in the restructured GenOn to the subsidiary’s creditors. At the time of the filing, GenOn had a total of 15,394 MW, just more than one-third of NRG’s power generation capacity. \n \nNRG on March 1 reported its full-year 2017 net loss was almost $1.55 billion, or $6.79 per diluted common share. The company said the loss includes a $1.8 billion impairment of fixed assets, goodwill, and investments, with $1.2 billion of that related to the South Texas Project nuclear generation facility, primarily due to the revised outlook of future commodity prices. \n \nMauricio Gutierrez, NRG’s president and CEO, in a March 1 news release said, “Our business continued its strong performance in a year when we announced our Transformation Plan aimed at simplifying and enhancing the business to deliver increased shareholder value. With this announcement, we are demonstrating measurable success towards achieving the goals of cost excellence, portfolio optimization and capital structure enhancements. I’m also proud to report that we did this while realizing our second-best safety year in company history.” \n \n— Darrell Proctor is a POWER associate editor (@DarrellProctor1, @POWERmagazine). \n \nThe post appeared first on POWER Magazine ."}

Through a partnership between Vodafone, Nokia, and Audi, the Moon is scheduled to get its very own mobile phone network sometime next year. \n \nVodafone will be designing the lunar network and will make use of equipment designed by Nokia Bell Labs. This connectivity will allow two Audi Lunar Quattro rovers to communicate wirelessly with a base station at the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. Using existing satellites, mission organizer Part Time Scientists will also be able to live stream scientific data and HD video content from the Moon to viewers on Earth. \n \nThe networking equipment will be launched into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and has been designed to be incredibly small. Nokia believes their network equipment will weigh less than one kilogram. \n \nAlthough development of 5G networks is making progress, they won't be ready in time for the 2019 launch and won't be robust enough for the harsh environment of space. While much faster than 4G networks, their range is considerably shorter and that's not good in space. Traditional analog communications like the ones used for the Apollo missions are much larger and require far more energy that modern digital communications. This makes 4G the perfect technology for this scenario. \n Related Reads   \nShare this article"}

{"articleID":33565634572,"title":"EON to Cut 5,000 Jobs in Overhaul of German Utilities","content":"The Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n\n(Bloomberg) -- EON SE will shed as many as 5,000 jobs in the deal to take over Innogy SE, a move that marks the biggest shakeup in Germany’s energy business in years. \n\nThe transaction agreed with its rival RWE AG values Innogy at 22 billion euros ($27.1 billion) and will sharpen the focus of Germany’s leading two electricity and natural gas providers, according to a joint statement on Monday. EON billed itself as the first formerly-integrated utility to focus entirely on meeting needs of 50 million customers across Europe. RWE said it doesn’t expect any net job losses. \n\nEON targets savings of 600 million euros to 800 million euros by 2022. It would become a grid manager and power provider focused on meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ambitious targets to cut pollution. For RWE, which is Europe’s biggest generator of electricity, the deal would provide it with renewables as an alternative to its current generation network that now is focused mainly on coal and nuclear power. \n\n“It’s EON’s first real growth step for more than a decade,” EON Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen said at a press conference on Tuesday in Essen, where all three of the utilities are based. “Our renewables businesses will find a promising home within a larger platform that will offer the necessary scale of size.” \n\nRWE CEO Rolf Martin Schmitz said “size is crucial” to exploit business opportunities as clean energy subsidies disappear and that conventional power assets will become “the beating heart of any future-proofed industrial society.” Markus Krebber, finance director for RWE, said in a Bloomberg Television interview that the deal “will entirely transform our company” by doubling earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \n\nEON shares surged more than 6 percent, continuing the biggest two-day increase in more than a year. RWE was up almost 3 percent after a 14 percent gain Monday, and Innogy was little changed just below the 40 euro a share offer price. \n\nMerkel is seeking to phase out coal-fired power generation in Germany and wants to deliver a plan by the end of this year. RWE owns half of the nation’s coal-fired power capacity. \n\n“The new RWE and EON entities provide investors with clearer differentiated opportunities,” Meredith Annex, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, wrote in a note to clients. “Investors can take stakes in RWE if they want power generation exposure, and in EON for distribution and retail exposure.” \n\nTo read how Germany is building the clout of its main energy companies, click here. \n\nEON’s voluntary takeover offer for Innogy will probably be completed by the middle of 2019, the companies said. RWE may take control of EON’s renewable energy assets by the end of 2019, when the full transaction is due to close subject to approval from antitrust authorities. \n\nFor a story on anti-trust hurdles for the Innogy deal, click here. \n\nPerella Weinberg Partners and BNP Paribas advised EON, with Linklaters acting as legal council. BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised RWE, and Rothschild provided a fairness opinion to RWE’s supervisory board and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer acting as legal council. \n\nRWE will end up with EON’s renewables business, minority stakes in two nuclear power plants, Innogy’s gas storage business and a stake in an Austrian energy supplier. Including the asset swaps, the whole transaction has an enterprise value of about 60 billion euros. \n\nFor a link to the statement from RWE and EON, click here. \n\nRWE reported an increase in full-year earnings on Tuesday while forecasting a decline in financial performance in 2018. The utility proposes a dividend of 1.5 euros for 2017, which includes a 1 euro special dividend. For 2018, the goal is to increase the ordinary dividend to 0.70 euros. \n\nEON also released earnings for 2017 that beat analysts forecasts, bringing forward its announcement by two days. Bloomberg News first reported the deal on March 10, with confirmation from the companies on Sunday and a full statement with terms of the transaction released on Monday evening.

{"articleID":33573726512,"title":"Toys ‘R’ Us to close all US stores","content":"New York (AFP) – Toys ‘R’ Us, the iconic retail chain that has captivated American kids for generations, has announced plans to shut all of its US stores, becoming one of the biggest casualties of the retail shakeout amid the rise of e-commerce. \n \nThe debt-plagued company announced in the early hours of Thursday that it has filed a motion for bankruptcy court approval to liquidate its US operations, a move that could hit 33,000 jobs. \n \n“This is a profoundly sad day for us as well as the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years,” chief executive Dave Brandon said in a statement. \n \n“I am very disappointed with the result, but we no longer have the financial support to continue the company’s US operations.” \n \nThe chain will shutter all 735 stores remaining in the United States, it said in a statement — down from the 881 it listed just last month. For shoppers, the company says gift cards will be honored for 30 days. \n \nThe privately-held company says it is exploring a plan to sell 200 top-performing US stores in a package deal with its Canadian division. \n \nThat scenario could potentially keep the Toys ‘R’ Us brand alive, but in a much reduced form compared with its pre-Internet heyday, when it thrilled generations of children with its well-stocked aisles and its friendly mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe. \n \n– Post-war growth – \n \nStarted in 1948 by World War II veteran Charles Lazarus at a single store in the US capital Washington, called “Children’s Bargain Town,” the company began calling itself Toys ‘R’ Us in 1957 and went public in 1978 after a period of heavy growth amid the post-war period. \n \nIts prominence as a vendor of stuffed animals, board games and later video games remained strong through the 1980s, but began to erode in the 1990s as big box stores such as Walmart and Target began selling more toys — at lower prices. \n \nBeset by these pressures, Toys ‘R’ Us in 2005 was taken private by a consortium of investors that included the KKR Group and Bain Capital in a move that saddled the company with billions of dollars of debt.  \n \nMore recently, Toys ‘R’ Us has been buffeted by the competition from Amazon and other online vendors, which have affected all retailers, leading to bankruptcies and creating a generation of “dead malls” around the United States as department stores and other shops vanish amid a shift to click-and-deliver purchases. \n \nIn September, the company filed for bankruptcy protection, hoping to reorganize $5 billion in long-term debt.  \n \nThe company’s goal during this past holiday season and beyond was “continuing to put huge smiles on children’s faces,” Brandon said. \n \nBut a weak Christmas shopping season weighed on the company’s efforts to reorganize, analysts said. \n \nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, blamed the company’s woes on poor leadership. \n \n“As the competitive dynamics of the toy market intensified, management failed to respond and evolve. As such, the brand lost relevance, customers and ultimately sales,” Saunders said in a note Wednesday. \n \n“The main tragedy of liquidation will be the extensive loss of jobs. In our view, those on the shop-floor have been badly let down by management and those doing financial deals. \n \nIn February, the company’s British business announced plans for an “orderly wind-down” of the company’s store portfolio.  \n \nToys ‘R’ Us employs 3,200 people at 100 stores in Britain. \n \nIn Thursday’s statement, the company said it is pursuing a “going concern” reorganization and sale process for its Canadian and international operations in Asia and Central Europe, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland. \n \n“The Company’s international operations in Australia, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain are considering their options in light of this announcement,” it said."}

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as investors expected, and said it could raise rates at a quicker pace next year. \n \nStocks traded higher early in the day and jumped after the Fed announced its decision. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 250, but gave it all up as new Fed chair Jerome Powell addressed reporters. At the end of trading it wobbled and ended lower. The dollar weakened and bond yields turned lower. Yields had risen earlier in the afternoon. \n \nDavid Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management, said stocks usually do well when rates are rising, to a point. \n \n\"If interest rates are rising from a low level, there's more optimism about the economy, and that generally is a more positive thing,\" he said. That's the case right now, but with an important difference: the economy has been growing for almost a decade, and interest rates have been historically low for the whole time. \n Existing-home sales up in Feb.  \nWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. sales of existing homes rebounded in February after declining for the previous two months. It's a sign that many Americans are still looking to buy despite rising prices and a shrinking number of homes available on the market. The National Association of Realtors says sales rose 3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million. \n AT&T merger case to be argued  \nNEW YORK — Opening arguments are set for Thursday in the federal government's case to block AT&T's efforts to gobble up Time Warner in a case that could shape how you get — and how much you pay for — streaming TV and movies. AT&T says it needs to buy Time Warner to compete with the likes of Amazon, Netflix and Google. The Justice Department's antitrust lawyers worry that consumers will end up paying more to watch their favorite shows, whether on a TV screen, smartphone or tablet. \n Meredith to cut 1,000 jobs in Time deal  \nDES MOINES, Iowa — Magazine and broadcasting company Meredith plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs over the next 10 months as it integrates the operations of Time Inc., which it bought six weeks ago. \n \nMeredith CEO Tom Harty said Wednesday 200 employees have been notified their positions were eliminated. That's in addition to an announcement last month that 600 jobs in a Time subscription fulfillment center in Tampa, Fla., would be eliminated with the center's closure. \n \nMeredith bought Time for $1.8 billion and expects to save $500 million in the first two years by combining operations. \n \nHarty says the company is exploring the sale of Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money magazines after concluding they have different audiences and advertising targets than Meredith's traditional lifestyle, food, and women's titles including Better Homes & Gardens."}

Even though the permanent natural satellite of earth is lifeless, the German branch of the multinational telecommunication company Vodafone has taken the initiative to team up with Nokia to build a 4G cell phone network in 2019. \n \nAccording to Xinhua , the network builder Vodafone has confirmed the news after providing a statement on their new collaboration to bring development in the communication process. \n \nA Berlin-based private space exploration company called PTScientists will be supporting the private lunar rover mission. The main focus of this mission will be to launch a lander and two small rovers to moon's surface via SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, taking off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, US. \n \nPTScientists has mentioned that even though it looks like an expensive project, the main objective of the team is to bringing down the cost of space exploration and democratizing access to the moon. \n \nThe project leader Vodafone has also mentioned that engineers will also build the energy efficient network by using Nokia's hardware, which will enable Audi-made lunar quattro rovers and then transmit the high definition footages including data back to the base station on earth. According to the company it is required to monitor the mission. \n \nThe statement included that Nokia's space-grade Ultra Compact Network, which is still in its initial stage of development, weight around 1kg and the lightest ever developed. \n \nIt is believed that the network will be able to broadcast on 1800 MHz frequency band, which will become the first direct live streaming HD transmission from lunar the surface. \n \nAccording to Times of India , CEO and founder of PTScientists Robert Bohme said that this is a critical process for sustainable exploration of the solar system but \"In order for humanity to leave the cradle of earth, we need to develop infrastructures beyond our home planet.\" \n \nHe also mentioned that through this mission, \"we will establish and test the first elements of a dedicated communications network on the moon.\" \n \n\"The great thing about this longterm evolution solution is that it saves so much power, and the less energy we use sending data, the more we have to do science,\" Bohme further added. \n \nThe CEO of German company Vodafone, Hannes Ametsreiter said that this project has a \"radically innovative approach to the development of the mobile network infrastructure.\" \n \nMoon, on the other hand, being the natural satellite and having the similar chemical composition as the earth was the best option to go ahead with such a revolutionary mission and the explanation on why moon has similarities like the blue earth is also mentioned in a theory called Synestia, which was proposed by Stewart and Simon Lock, a graduate student at Harvard and a visiting student at UC Davis. \n \nThe theory explained that after the strike in millions of years ago, synestia was formed which is a giant cloud of molten vapour. While the vapour combines all the elements and creates the earth at the centre, at the same time some floating debris formed the Moon."}

The tech-centric hotel offers digital check-in, USB ports throughout its vibrant lobby and a tech lounge with complimentary computers and internet.

This makes Ray the perfect person to lead the charge for us in these markets.” \n \nRay added, “When I learned how Surgent’s adaptive technology works, I leapt at the chance to help educate the market about it. Top accounting firms are hiring the best and brightest accounting and finance students, who have just learned much of the content tested on the exam. Surgent’s course is the only one on the market that actually uses these students’ knowledge to their advantage. The technology assesses them, figures out what they know, then customizes their study plans to skip what the students already know and focus their very limited study hours where they actually need the help. It’s a no brainer, in my mind, both for the students and the firms that employ them.” \n \nAbout Surgent CPA Review \nWhile Surgent CPA Review is a young company, its founders are no strangers to the accounting or education spaces. The Exam Prep division was born out of Surgent, a 30-year leader in tax, accounting, and finance professional education. Since Surgent CPA Review’s launch in August of 2015, the company has quickly become the fastest-growing exam review course in the industry. Its trademark A.S.A.P Technology delivers an algorithmic-based adaptive learning experience that is targeted to an individual’s unique areas of need. Surgent students save up to 400 hours of study time, and achieve pass rates that are nearly double the national average. In addition to CPA Exam prep , Surgent’s A.S.A.P. Technology now powers courses for the Enrolled Agent (EA) , Certified Management Accountant (CMA) , Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) , and Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA ) designations.

That year coincides with a scheduled general election in Prokopakis pointed to a failure of the coalition government to negotiate for the remaining and unused funds allocated as part of the third memorandum bailout for Greece, which he said would be preferable to market lending once the country is outside the low-interest and guaranteed memorandum. This causes credit asphyxiation for the battered Greek economy, he warned. \n \nThe post appeared first on The National Herald ."}
{"articleID":33669863099,"title":"Deutsche Bank Is Said to Consider More Cuts at Investment Bank","content":"The Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n\n(Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG is conducting a fresh review of its investment bank that could lead to deeper cuts across the trading businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nThe bank’s U.S. operations are a particular focus, though the review stretches across the firm’s global trading unit, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. Europe’s largest investment bank is examining businesses where it’s trailing competitors to determine if it should try to win back market share or exit, the people said. \n\nSenior executives plan to complete the review, dubbed “Project Colombo,” within weeks, before deciding where to cut and where to invest, said two people. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. \n\nThe future of the investment bank, the lender’s largest unit by revenue, has been a central point of contention at the company as Chief Executive Officer John Cryan struggles to turn the business around since he took over in mid-2015. Investors’ frustration with the lack of growth at Deutsche Bank have prompted Chairman Paul Achleitner to search for a successor to Cryan, people familiar have said. \n\nFor more on the conflict between the CEO and Chairman click here. \n\nAs part of the investment bank review, cuts are being discussed at both big trading businesses -- equities as well as fixed income, currencies and commodities -- because they are expensive and haven’t performed well, said one person. However, the extent of a potential retrenchment is unclear because many traders just got big bonuses in an effort to retain top performers, this person said. \n\nIt’s also unclear how the search for a new CEO will affect the review. \n\nMuch of the prior cutbacks at the investment bank affected fixed-income trading, though revenue at the equities unit declined as well. The bank lost clients in late 2016 amid concerns about its financial strength. Revenue from trading has declined by about a third in the past two years. \n\nThe CEO last year merged the global markets division with the corporate and investment bank, reversing the decision from 2015 to split the businesses. In the 2017 overhaul, the bank named former finance chief Marcus Schenck to help oversee the new unit, while Cryan himself assumed oversight for the lender’s U.S. operations. The bank recently hired a former Goldman Sachs executive, Peter Selman, in a bid to revive the equities business. \n\n“I am focused on growing revenue and prudently managing expenses to improve profitability,” Selman said in an interview earlier this year. Along with hiring graduates, Selman said he will invest in Deutsche Bank’s technology to build a “best-in-class electronic platform” over the long term. The bank already has good products for derivatives clients, he said. \n\nTo read more about Deutsche Bank’s equities business, click here. \n\nChief Financial Officer James von Moltke said at a conference in London last week that any cuts to the investment bank would probably be gradual. \n\n“We will take actions to prune the business this year,” Von Moltke also said at the conference. Radical cuts are “not something we think is advisable and the right thing either for the franchise or for shareholders,” he said. \n\n--With assistance from Donal Griffin \n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Steven Arons in Frankfurt at sarons@bloomberg.net, Stephen Morris in London at smorris39@bloomberg.net, Elisa Martinuzzi in London at emartinuzzi@bloomberg.net. \n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net, Christian Baumgaertel \n\n©2018 Bloomberg L.P. \n\nThe Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n.

The ExoLab project is made available in the country by I-Innovate as part of its mission to facilitate cutting-edge STEM programmes and to bring 21st-century learning experiences into South African classrooms. \n \nThe participation of Claremont High School and the Cape Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology in this particular ExoLab project is made possible by a sponsorship from Tata Consultancy Services. \n \nThese schools, serving many learners from disadvantaged Cape communities, will join others in more than 90 classrooms around the world that will be connected to the ExoLab in the ISS after the April launch. \n  \n“I-Innovate believes in inspiring potential in young learners and preparing them for future challenges and adventures in the real world,” says I-Innovate CEO, Trisha Crookes. \n \n“The cutting-edge ExoLab programme gives South African teachers and students first-hand, real-time access to global scientists, engineers and astronauts. It connects students’ learning in the classroom directly to current endeavours in Space; igniting the possibilities for their future and making learning personally meaningful and exciting to them through these unique, hands-on experiences. ExoLab is the kind of extraordinary educational experience that can inspire a passion for learning in a young person that will last them a lifetime.” \n  \nAt the centre of the plant biology investigation that spans from Earth to space is Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly known as thale cress. This is a small flowering plant native to Africa and Eurasia that is often the organism of choice for a variety of plant science studies. Its genome has been fully mapped. \n \nGreg van Schalkwyk, Principal at The Cape Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology noted that: \n  \n“This project with ExoLab makes the curriculum more relevant for our kids. They are living in a world of Apps, Virtual Intelligence and Robotics. This is an opportunity for our educators to collaborate with ExoLab and stimulate our kids through real-life exposure that can prepare them for future jobs.” \n  \nTo facilitate their participation in the project, Claremont High and Cape Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology schools will each receive fully-equipped Earth-based growth chambers and the resources they need to replicate the experiment taking place on ISS. \n \nOver six to eight weeks, they will use their specialised classroom growth chamber to grow Arabidopsis thaliana and track its development in comparison to the same species of plant grown aboard the ISS ExoLab through a camera-linked, live-stream, online learning platform. A detailed curriculum providing hands-on classroom activities guides teachers and learners through this stimulating learning process. \n \n\n \nLearners, who will be ground-breaking African participants in the initiative, reacted with enthusiasm at the announcement of their inclusion in this extraordinary project: Jade Segers, a Grade 9 learner at The Cape Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology said: \n  \n“I am very excited about the ExoLab project because it is so interesting. It’s really cool that we can connect with people in Space!” \n  \nViwe Mbava, A Grade 12 learner at Claremont High School said: \n  \n“I am very excited to be part of ExoLab because it is very different and ground-breaking. I want to understand the Universe better by seeing how this plant adapts.” \n  \n\n Sources: Press Release  Have something to add to this story?

Terms were not disclosed. \n \nSmith said the store in Quadrangle Shopping Center will become an independently owned Piggly Wiggly by the end of April. It is not associated with Piggly Wiggly Carolina, which sold or closed many of its stores in 2013 as the former Lowcountry-based stalwart began to dissolve amid financial woes. \n \nThe reincarnated Piggly Wiggly will add to the existing four namesake stores in the Greater Charleston market — in Hollywood, Moncks Corner, North Charleston and Summerville. \n \nThe 31,000-square-foot supermarket employs 60 people. Smith said all of the employees will be considered for existing jobs after reapplying. \n \nThe store started as Piggly Wiggly in 1990, opening shortly after Hurricane Hugo battered a previous location down the street on Savannah Highway where the Sofa Super Store stood until a tragic fire in 2007 claimed nine firefighters' lives. \n \n\"I saw an opportunity, and I decided to take it,\" Smith, of Goose Creek, said. \n \nThe sale is expected to help Bi-Lo's parent company, Southeastern Grocers, overcome some of its debt burden as it works through bankruptcy reorganization. \n \nIt comes after the Jacksonville-based company announced earlier this month it will shutter four of its 15 stores in the Charleston area: in Ladson, Mount Pleasant, North Charleston and Summerville. Liquidation sales are underway. \n \nSoutheastern Grocers also is closing 15 other stores across South Carolina, including five of its Harveys-branded supermarkets. None is in the Charleston area. \n \nAltogether, the company is closing 94 underperforming stores across the Southeast and is expected to reduce its debt by more than $500 million. \n \nThe sale of the West Ashley Bi-Lo will leave the company with 10 stores in the Charleston region. \n \nBi-Lo operates two other stores in West Ashley: on Bees Ferry Road and Sam Rittenberg Boulevard. \n \nSmith and his wife, Hayley, bought the last corporate-owned Piggly Wiggly in the Charleston area in Hollywood in 2016, when he decided to strike out on his own after working in the grocery business for more than two decades. \n \nBefore owning his own store, Smith, 40, worked for Piggly Wiggly Carolina for 20 years as an assistant produce manager and then worked as the wholesale manager of perishable merchandising for New Hampshire-based C&S Wholesale Grocers, which supplies Piggly Wiggly supermarkets and others. \n \nSoutheastern Grocers also is selling two other Bi-Lo stores in South Carolina and three Harveys stores in Georgia to independent Piggly Wiggly owners. The Bi-Lo locations are in Abbeville and Clover. The Harveys stores are in Lakeland and Homerville, Ga.  \n \nAll of the supermarkets will become Piggly Wiggly stores."}

Klean Hydration is gluten-free, dairy-free and non-GMO, and it contains no artificial sweeteners, flavors or colors, making it a preferable choice for athletes of all levels seeking to maximize their health and performance without the high sugar content and additives found in many hydration products. \"When you are sweating for longer than an hour, day in and day out, water is far from ideal for maintaining proper hydration status,\" says Kelly Heim, PhD, Senior Director of Scientific Affairs for Klean Athlete, who helped develop Klean Hydration. \"Relying on water alone can result in delayed or impaired fluid absorption and actually diminish an athlete's desire to drink in the late stages of extended exertion. For these reasons, we recommend that athletes opt for a hydration beverage with a balanced mix of carbohydrates and electrolytes.\"\n\nKlean Hydration contains six percent carbohydrates, which research shows is the optimal amount to support athletic performance in a variety of settings. In addition, Klean Hydration contains carefully calculated quantities of essential minerals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium to replace electrolytes lost through sweat during physical activity. The osmotic concentration, or osmolarity, of Klean Hydration is similar to body fluids, allowing it to be well tolerated and maximize hydration efficiency.‡ \n\nSponsored by: Klean Hydration is one of a limited number of NSF Certified for SportÃ‚® products to address the sports hydration market. This certification is the gold standard for professional sports organizations, including the NFL, PGA, MLB and NHL, as well as for athletes, coaches and trainers striving to make more informed decisions when choosing sports supplements. Products bearing the NSF Certified for SportÃ‚® mark, including Klean Hydration, are independently tested on a lot-by-lot basis for more than 270 substances banned by major athletic organizations. In addition, products are tested for harmful levels of specific contaminants like lead and arsenic. The NSF Certified for SportÃ‚® mark also confirms that the contents of the supplement match what is printed on the label, providing athletes with an extra level of assurance about the safety of their nutritional products. \n\n\"Klean Hydration is another example of Klean Athlete's ongoing commitment to clean sport by offering exclusively NSF Certified for SportÃ‚® products,\" explained Brian Jordan, RSCC*D, technical manager for NSF Certified for SportÃ‚® at NSF International. \"The brand's commitment to developing NSF Certified for SportÃ‚® certified nutritional supplements and their expansion into new product categories make it possible for athletes to fuel their bodies without risking the integrity of their performance.\"\n\nProper hydration before, during and after exercise is vital for optimal physical performance and recovery. Even modest dehydration of one percent of body weight can result in diminished exercise capacity. Fluid losses resulting in a two- to three-percent decrease in body weight result in significant physiological stress. In extreme situations, muscle may even be broken down to generate liquid. Klean Hydration should be used to hydrate, maintain electrolyte balance and rehydrate before, during and after exercise.‡ \n\nKlean Hydration is available in a 12.6-ounce canister (MSRP $27.00) and as single-serve sachets (MSRP $19.00 for 10 sachets), providing versatility for athletes on the go.

However, with the new BIS Act..., it has the provisions to allow third parties such as us to also act a certification agency,” he said.\n\nThe testing, inspection and certification market is expected to be worth $247.94 billion by 2023, according to a report by MarketsandMarkets.\n\nIt is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.02% from $184.77 billion in 2017. \n\nThe growth will be mainly driven by harmonisation of standards, growing consumption of goods in emerging countries and imposition of rigorous government regulations across various sectors.\n\n“There are areas..., for example in medical devices, one or two areas have been approved [by India] but business is yet to start. Indian medical rules came into effect in January this year. Medical devices are very complex as they go from simple gloves to syringes and CT scans. Anything that goes into the body is of extreme risk.\n\n“For certain low-risk categories, the Indian government is allowing third-party certification. That is starting. We are awaiting clearance... It may take a few months. They go through their checks and process,” Mr. Sugavanam said.\n\nTesting labs\n\nUL South Asia has set up four multi-speciality labs in India. These laboratories test products ranging from electricals to garments and shoes. Four such labs are in India — three in Bengaluru and one in Gurugram. \n\nThe fifth laboratory for textiles is based out of Dhaka.\n\nThe Indian government’s decision to allow third-party certification would be one of the drivers of growth, he said, The parent firm is a not-for-profit organisation focussed on research, outreach, setting standards and educating the customer.\n\nRather than advising clients after a product is developed, UL South Asia is helping them comply with safety, security, and sustainability at the research and development stage, he said.\n\n“We constantly look at... cost of compliance. If it is a mobile phone, we have to test its electrical [connections], the radiation and the communication protocols, whether its Bluetooth will work with the audio and the car...\n\nCost of non-compliance\n\n“At the same time, you also look at the cost of non-compliance. If you eventually end up launching a product which is not compliant with the standards and therefore, if it catches fire when you charge or if it creates excessive radiation, it damages not just reputation but your company can be completely obliterated. The cost of compliance as a rule of thumb for any product is about 0.1% of the revenue. The cost of non-compliance will be much bigger.”\n\nUL South Asia is working with 30 medical start-ups at an early stage. \n\n“If you are designing a product in India, some of these... don’t even have a regulation. Frankly, you and I can make a blood glucose monitor in our backyard and sell. Nobody is going to ask a question in India. If you sell these devices in the Middle East there are rules you [have] to follow. USFDA is even more strict.”\n\nMr. Sugavanam said the opportunity for renewable energy and transaction security was “huge” in India. \n\n“Renewable energy in India will be huge for at least the next six to seven years. If you look at the pace at which wind and solar energy is growing, the grid connectors and other applications for the solar industry is growing at the same pace at which the wind sector went through in the nineties. That creates a growth area for us."}

School district fleets may leverage this technology to be compliant with the Paul Lee School Bus Safety Law , which requires busing fleets to be equipped with a child safety alert system to help ensure all students have exited the bus. As part of the agreement, Zonar will offer an option to integrate the Child Check-Mate System into its ZAlerts and  Electronic Verified Inspection Reporting  (EVIR®) software, providing an extra layer of safety by creating digital recordings of missed inspections and sending real-time alerts to notify dispatch of issues. \n \n“We want to make sure bus drivers and school officials have an easy way to help ensure that no student is ever left on the bus – after all, their top concern is to keep the children in their care safe,” said H. Kevin Mest, senior vice president of passenger services at Zonar Systems. “In addition to selling the Child Check-Mate System on its own, using the technology with Zonar’s ZAlerts builds on the intent of the law by sending real-time alerts to management when child checks fail to happen, creating another way to help make sure your kid gets home safe.” \n \nDigital alerts are important because there are incidents where an alarm sounds in a large bus yard or parked at a driver’s home or a satellite terminal/parkout without supervisory personnel present to hear the alarm. A ZAlert ensures a notification is sent to dispatch when an alarm goes off, identifying exactly which bus was not properly checked and showing its current location. The digital recording of incidents can also be used by school bus fleet managers to track how often incidents occur, identify trends and coach drivers towards better safety practices. \n \n“More than 20 million students ride school buses each year and our goal is to make sure no child gets left behind on a vehicle,” said Brad Both, CEO of, Child Check-Mate System. “When paired together, our solutions are not only easy to implement and use, but help school drivers and fleet managers prevent these types of incidents and even increase their standards of safety and general practices.” \n \nThe Paul Lee School Bus Safety Law was established in recognition of a Whittier student who passed away after being left unattended on a school bus for several hours. Under the new law, schools are required to equip all buses with a child safety alert system to ensure all students have exited the bus upon ride completion. Drivers must manually contact or scan the device at the interior back of the bus to confirm the completed visual inspection before leaving the vehicle unattended after each route. School bus drivers will also be required to complete annual inspection training to receive their renewed safety certificates. \n \nAbout Zonar \nFounded in 2001, Zonar has pioneered smart fleet management solutions throughout vocational, pupil, mass transit and commercial trucking industries. Zonar helps fleets of all sizes maximize the use of their assets with solutions dedicated to improving compliance, efficiency, maintenance, ridership visibility, safety and tracking. Cloud-based services with open API's drive Zonar's smart fleet solutions by making it easy for fleet owners and managers to stay connected to their fleets and drivers and operators to dispatch. Headquartered in Seattle and majority-owned by technology company Continental, Zonar also has a Technology Development Center in downtown Seattle, a regional office in Cincinnati, and a distribution center outside of Atlanta. For more information about Zonar, go to http://www.zonarsystems.com . \n \nChild Check-Mate System, Inc. \nChild Check-Mate System is a Canadian school bus safety Company who has developed and patented a unique alarm system which acts as an electronic reminder to drivers. This reminder helps ensure that all children have safely disembarked the vehicle upon the completion of each run. The system was designed “by drivers for drivers”. It was the collaborative efforts of these drivers, a concerned operator, and talented bus mechanic which made the idea a reality. Since 1993 the Child Check-Mate System continues to endure some of North America’s harshest weather conditions; proving itself both as a reliable investment to operators and as an extremely valuable safety aid to the drivers who use it.

{"articleID":33663807862,"title":"Who should go at Deutsche Bank: The chairman or CEO?","content":"Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner has held talks with potential successors to Chief Executive John Cryan as part of plans to replace the executive should a better candidate emerge, according to people with knowledge of the matter. \n \nDiscussions have focused on a leader who speaks German and who works well with regulators, the people said, asking not to be identified. Achleitner has sounded out potential replacements as part of normal succession planning, they said. One top shareholder — asking not to be identified discussing sensitive matters — said Cryan remains the best choice as CEO of the bank. \n \nCryan has struggled to maintain investor backing after failing to return the lender to “controlled growth” as part of the bank’s third strategy revamp. A sustained slide at the investment bank has contributed to hundreds of job cuts as the bank seeks to curb costs and improve returns. The shares have declined about 29% this year, the second-worst performer in the 43-member Bloomberg Europe 500 Banks and Financial Services Index. \n \n“Deutsche Bank’s restructuring isn’t going as some had hoped, and that’s bound to raise questions about management,” Daniel Regli, an analyst at MainFirst in Zurich who has an underperform recommendation on Deutsche Bank shares, said by phone on Tuesday. “I don’t think Cryan is the problem. It goes deeper.” \n Power struggle? Deutsche Bank is considering removing CEO John Cryan (left) amid heightened tensions between him and Chairman Paul Achleitner, the Times of London reported. The bank approached Richard Gnodde of Goldman Sachs and considered Jean Pierre Mustier of UniCredit and Bill Winters of Standard Chartered, the Times said. Bloomberg News  \n\nWhile much of the focus of shareholder discontent has focused on Cryan, one top shareholder criticized Achleitner for the perceived failure to find a replacement for Cryan more quickly. Other analysts and investors — pointing to the turmoil at the bank during the chairman’s tenure — also said that the chairman bears responsibility for the bank’s travails. \n \n“I think the main problem at Deutsche Bank is Mr. Paul Achleitner,” Stefan Mueller, CEO of DGWA, the German Institute for Asset and Equity Allocation and Valuation, said on Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “He implemented all these CEOs in the last years to make it happen that Deutsche Bank, formerly one of the best banks in the world, is still somehow distressed.” \n \nDieter Hein, an analyst at Fairesearch who has a sell recommendation on the bank’s stock, said Achleitner ‘isn’t part of the solution — he’s part of the problem.” \n \nThe Times of London reported that the lender is considering removing the CEO amid heightened tensions between him and Achleitner, without saying where it got the information. It has approached Richard Gnodde, head of Goldman Sachs Group's international operations, but he’s thought to have spurned the overture, it said. Deutsche Bank also considered UniCredit SpA CEO Jean Pierre Mustier and Standard Chartered Plc CEO Bill Winters, the report said. \n \nDeutsche Bank spokeswoman Monika Schaller declined to comment on the Times’s report. The newspaper said Goldman Sachs also declined to comment. \n \n“The fact that the bank isn’t responding to these media reports seems to indicate that the bank is willing to sacrifice Cryan,” said Markus Riesselmann, an analyst with Independent Research who has a sell recommendation on the stock. \n \nAchleitner and Cryan have reportedly clashed on areas including the bank’s strategy and its relations with HNA Group, one of the bank’s largest shareholders. \n \nFinding the right kind of replacement for Cryan may prove tricky. At least two top shareholders don’t think that the two deputy CEOs — retail co-head Christian Sewing and investment bank co-head Marcus Schenck — are CEO material just yet. Schenck is partly responsible for the investment bank’s performance, and Sewing doesn’t have the necessary investment banking expertise, according to people briefed on the investors’s thinking. \n \nThe bank’s share price has more than halved during Cryan’s tenure as CEO, and he has yet to deliver on his promise to regain market share in investment banking, made after the bank raised 8-billion euros in capital about a year ago. \n \nFinding a suitable external candidate is proving difficult as the bank’s requirements limit the potential pool.

{"articleID":33574540596,"title":"Yale-Puerto Rico partnership receives grant to strengthen science education","content":"NEW HAVEN, CT - The Yale Ciencia Initiative, a collaboration between Yale University and the non-profit Ciencia Puerto Rico (CienciaPR), received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to encourage Puerto Rican students to explore, present, and implement scientific solutions to the challenges created by hurricanes Irma and Maria. The grant, amounting to $186,086 for one year, was one of 23 awarded by the federal agency to do research in Puerto Rico related to the recent natural disasters, and the only one in the field of education. \n\nThe project will train more than 40 middle school educators and principals to implement a series of project-based learning (PBL) science lessons that are relevant to students’ lives in the aftermath of the hurricanes. Through the lessons students will identify how science can address pressing needs in their schools and communities, in relation to the availability of drinking water and changes to terrestrial ecosystems, among other issues. \n \nThe participating schools will receive the lessons, which are aligned with the standards of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) and the Next Generation Science Standards, and all the materials necessary to implement them, which include the innovative paper microscope known as Foldscope. They will also receive support to present the results of the projects to their communities and disseminate them through the CienciaPR.org website, a platform that connects more than 8,500 scientists, students and educators in Puerto Rico and beyond. \n \nAccording to Dr. Giovanna Guerrero-Medina, Director of the Yale Ciencia Initiative and Principal Investigator, “the project is designed to test effective educational practices after a major natural disaster. Through the lessons, we seek to transform adversity into a positive challenge by empowering students to be critical thinkers and problem solvers.” \n \nEvaluation of educational strategies \n \nThe investigators will not only train and offer tools to educators but will also be analyzing the feasibility of implementing these socially and culturally relevant PBL lessons to serve the whole student population after a natural disaster. The organization also seeks to evaluate the impact of these lessons on students’ learning and attitudes towards science. In Puerto Rico, schools are used as shelters and support centers for communities at risk, which represents additional pressures for the education system during and after an emergency. This in turn affects the restoration of their educational functions. For many children, the trauma of the emergency is combined with the fact that they cannot reach their schools, that they are closed or not operating at full capacity, and their learning is interrupted. \n \n“We want to know if PBL strategies, which helps students learn concepts in a more independent way and through problem-solving, can be an effective tool in the event of a disaster. What we learn from this study can also be of great value in other parts of the world,” says Dr. Greetchen Díaz Muñoz, Director of Science Education Programs and Community Partnerships of CienciaPR and co-investigator in the project. \n \nAbout the Yale Ciencia Initiative and Ciencia Puerto Rico \n \nLocated within Yale School of Medicine’s Office for Diversity and Inclusion, the Yale Ciencia Initiative is an effort to expand access to scientific knowledge, experiences, and careers among communities or populations traditionally underrepresented in, or underserved by, the scientific enterprise. Through research, programs, and collaborations with Yale faculty, the Yale Ciencia Initiative aims to promote scholarship on how science networks can enhance the engagement and participation of people from diverse backgrounds in science and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science within Yale and on a national level. \n \nThe Yale Ciencia Initiative is a collaboration between Yale and Ciencia Puerto Rico (CienciaPR, www.cienciapr.org ), a global community of more than 8,500 scientists, students, educators, and allies who believe that science can empower individuals with the knowledge, capacity, and agency to improve their lives and society. CienciaPR leverages its rich and diverse community to democratize science and transform science education and career training. CienciaPR’s efforts over the last decade have garnered multiple recognitions, including being named a  Bright Spot for Hispanic STEM Education by the White House in 2"}

{"articleID":33561257970,"title":"Your baby monitor could be spying on you: Kaspersky Lab","content":"Kaspersky Lab researchers have discovered multiple security vulnerabilities in popular smart cameras that are frequently used as baby monitors, or for internal home and office security surveillance.  \n \nThe uncovered flaws could allow attackers to obtain remote access to video and audio feeds from the cameras, remotely disable these devices, execute arbitrary malicious code on them and do many other things. \n \nKaspersky Lab researchers contacted and reported the vulnerabilities to Hanwha Techwin, the manufacturer of the affected cameras. At the time of publication, some vulnerabilities had already been fixed, and the remaining vulnerabilities are set to be completely fixed soon, according to the manufacturer. \n \nModern smart cameras contain an advanced number of functions, providing users with various opportunities: people can use them as advanced baby monitors or for surveillance systems which spot intruders while no one is home or in the office. \n \nPrevious analysis conducted by many other security researchers has shown that smart cameras in general tend to contain security vulnerabilities at different levels of severity. \n \nHowever, in their latest research, Kaspersky Lab experts uncovered something extraordinary: not just one, but a whole range of smart cameras was found to be vulnerable to a number of severe remote attacks. \n \nThis was due to an insecurely designed cloud-backbone system that was initially created to enable the owners of these cameras to remotely access video from their devices. \n \nBy exploiting these vulnerabilities, malicious users could potentially ccess video and audio feeds from any camera connected to the vulnerable cloud service; remotely gain root access to a camera and use it as an entry-point for further attacks on other devices on both local and external networks; steal personal information such as users’ social network accounts and information which is used to send users notifications; and even remotely “brick” vulnerable cameras. \n \nAll these attacks were possible because experts found that the way the cameras interacted with the cloud service was insecure and open to relatively easy interference. They also found that the architecture of the cloud service itself was vulnerable to external interference. \n \nIt is important to note that such attacks were only possible if attackers knew the serial number of the camera. However, the way in which serial numbers are generated is relatively easy to find out through simple brute-force attacks: the camera registering system didn’t have brute force protection. \n \nWhile doing their research, Kaspersky Lab experts were able to identify almost 2,000 vulnerable cameras working online, but these were only the cameras that had their own IP address, hence were directly available through the internet. The real number of vulnerable devices placed behind routers and firewalls could actually be several times higher. \n \nIn addition, researchers found an undocumented functionality, which could be used by the manufacturer for final production test purposes. However, at the same time criminals could use this hidden avenue to send wrong signals to any camera or change a command already sent to it. Besides that, the feature itself was found to be vulnerable. It could be further exploited with a buffer overflow, potentially leading to the camera’s shutdown. The vendor has now fixed the issue and removed this feature. \n \nThe post appeared first on Tahawul Tech ."}

Designed and facilitated by Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory Cyber Risk Services in an effort to support the development of the next generation of cyber leaders, the Deloitte Foundation Cyber Threat Competition provides a competitive and interactive forum for college students to hone the skills needed to address increasingly sophisticated cyber risks in the marketplace. \n\n\"To help prepare the next generation of cybersecurity professionals for the challenges that lie ahead, this competition provides a forum for students to be immersed in real-world scenarios and instills a better understanding of the cybersecurity threats faced by today's organizations and how to mitigate the associated risks,\" said Anthony Russo, Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal, Deloitte & Touche LLP. \"Despite efforts from many organizations, closing the cyber skills gap continues to be a forefront challenge, with an anticipated 3.5 million unfilled positions by 2021.\" \n\nIn fact, a recent Deloitte poll found that nearly half of all respondents surveyed struggle to identify (21.1 percent) and attract (23.2 percent) talent with the technical and business skills necessary to meet changing and growing cybersecurity demands, and even more (65 percent) feel as though the cyber talent gap affects their businesses' operations. \n\n\"In our connected world, cybersecurity is no longer just an option but instead a business requirement that, if unaddressed, can impact every part of an organization,\" said Tonie Leatherberry, principal, Deloitte & Touche LLP and president of the Deloitte Foundation. \"Our mission is to recognize this transition and support future leaders who will need to address one of the most important challenges facing the economy and society.\"\n\nUniversities play an important role in accelerating positive change and ensuring students, regardless of major, are prepared to address cyber risks at the future businesses they will support. The Deloitte Foundation Cyber Threat Competition is designed to complement these efforts by providing practical application of the skills required to excel in the industry.

A truck has to help a customer do the best job possible. That is as true in the Middle East and Africa as anywhere else. We are now taking our latest Actros and Arocs models to those markets, with the aim of leveraging the momentum experienced across those regions.”   \n  \n \nThe regional launch of the new generation of heavy-duty trucks – the new Mercedes-Benz Actros and Arocs – was celebrated in an evening of extraordinary style in the sea, just off the Dubai Marina and Jumeirah Beach Residences on 7 th March, followed by a day of driving experience and engaging workshops. The event shone a spotlight on the efficiency, reliability, sophistication and design defining the latest evolution of Mercedes-Benz Trucks launched in the Middle East and Africa. \n \n  \n \nAttended by more than 300 VIP customers and media from the Middle East and Africa, and hosted by Daimler’s Commercial Vehicles Regional Offices MENA and Africa based in Dubai, the dramatic reveal of the new models included a stunning off-shore light and laser show display in proximity to Dubai’s new iconic Ain Dubai Eye Ferris wheel. \n \n  \n \nEarlier in the day, media enjoyed an exclusive launch preview of the new models, exploring the trucks’ capabilities on Dubai’s Autodrome Racetrack – and off-road at a Desert Camp – and gaining additional insight from senior members of the Mercedes-Benz Trucks global team. \n \n  \n \nCommenting on the launch, Stefan Buchner, Head of Mercedes-Benz Trucks globally said: “Our Mercedes-Benz Actros and Arocs have proved that they can be relied on – as our customers do day in, day out, in many markets around the world.

Assembled at the world’s largest truck plant in Woerth, Germany, the trucks come in specifically developed variants for the Middle East and Africa – designed and built to withstand the harshest operating conditions. \n \n  \n \nTested extensively around the world, on both surfaced roads and in the most challenging terrain, these vehicles are a perfect platform for heavy-duty applications. Testing included a total of more than 6 million kilometres of endurance runs performed by the Mercedes-Benz Trucks Testing Center based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. \n \n  \n \nDistinctive new cabs boast high material quality and perfect ergonomics, while operation is easy and comfortable.

{"articleID":33555158728,"title":"Review: 2018 Mercedes-Benz S 450 petrol India review, test drive","content":"13 th Mar 2018 4:50 pm  \nWhile not as revolutionary as its straight-six diesel counterpart, this V6 petrol motor should be well suited to the S-class. \n  \nWhat is it? \nYou’ve already seen our review of the diesel-powered S-class, the facelifted S 350d , with its revolutionary new engine that has been extensively re-engineered for India to meet 2020’s BS-VI standards, despite running on 2018’s BS-IV fuel. This S 450 is the six-cylinder petrol variant, but unlike the diesel, it’s not a new-generation straight-six engine, but instead, the old 3.0-litre V6 (formerly called the S 400) reworked to produce more power. We never got a chance to test the S 400, so this review should tell us a lot about this engine; and since ultimate refinement is what you want from a car like the S-class, perhaps this will prove to be even better than the already polished diesel. \n \nWe’ll gloss over the things that are common with the diesel variant, such as the exterior and the interior. The facelift is pretty standard stuff – revised headlamps, tail-lamps, grille, bumpers and wheels that, combined, give the S-class a slightly more aggressive and imposing look – which is intentional, say the designers – but some of that regal elegance has been lost in the facelift. \n  \nWhat’s it like inside? \nAs in the diesel, everything is superbly crafted and incredibly luxurious. There’s a new 64-colour ambient lighting system, and you now get wireless charging for your phone at the front and rear, although the rubber cradle at the front feels a bit flimsy for an S-class and isn’t big enough to accommodate large ‘plus size’ smartphones. \n \nWhen it comes to the driver interface, there’s a new steering wheel that now features many more controls on it, including Cruise Control. It also gets the new dual mini touch pads that debuted on the E-class, which, by far, are the best for controlling the COMAND interface on the go. The dual 12.5-inch screens for the infotainment and instrumentation appear sharper and now have a few options for their appearance – including a decidedly un-limo-like ‘Progressive’ look, with a digital speedo, the tacho in the centre and a G-force meter on the side. What’s nice, however, is that they are deeply customisable to show various readouts other than just a speedo and tacho. But of course, the highlight of an S-class is the comfort, and as ever, it’s hard to fault this. \n \nA few things have been deleted from the front seats like the massage, memory and cooling functions, which is unusual in a Rs 1.4 crore car, but the back is where it’s at. The rear seats fold out and recline by 43.5 degrees, and get heating, cooling and massaging function, with memory. The left-rear passenger even gets an ottoman to prop their calves on, and the left front seat folds away for maximum legroom. Frankly, though new rivals do come close, it’s hard to imagine any of them offering a better back seat experience than this. \n  \nWhat’s it like to drive? \nDynamically, it’s no different from the diesel S 350d. It too gets air suspension at all four ends that delivers a supreme ride quality like few other cars can. You’d have to find a pretty big pothole, speed breaker or bump to hit to elicit anything close to discomfort from this car; it’s almost worth those uninteresting-looking 18-inch wheels, when you realise they’re wrapped in tall 50-profile rubber that no doubt adds to the comfort. It does get a little bit too wallowy at high speeds if the road is undulating, but that’s when you should switch to Sport mode. Be under no illusion; this doesn’t make it a sporty handler, but instead, it just contains the body movements much better. Similarly, the steering does weight up in Sport mode, but it is engineered too slow and mushy to ever be dynamically engaging. And that’s fair enough in a limousine. \n \nThat said, and since this is a petrol variant, can you expect a whiff of performance when you choose this over the diesel? Certainly, with 367hp and 500Nm of torque (up by 34hp and 20Nm from the old S 400) and a claimed 5.1sec 0-100kph time, it would seem that way on paper. It also has the advantage of the newer, cleverer nine-speed automatic, compared to the seven-speed unit in the last car. \n \nIt is impressively brisk off the line, the gearbox quietly whizzing through the first handful of gears. It doesn’t have that effortless mid-range surge that you get from the turbo V8 or V12 motors, obviously, but what it has instead is a surprisingly sporty nature. It does, definitely, feel quicker than the diesel, despite a 100Nm torque deficit. The power delivery is smooth and comes in really strong from about 3,000rpm onwards. So yes, if you’re desperately late to that shareholders’ meeting, Jeeves will have a decently good time hustling you along. \n  \nBut the real advantage is refinement. The new diesel is incredibly hushed, but this is nigh on silent. It’s only closer to 3,000rpm that you’ll actually hear it, and at idle, you’d have to be close to the tailpipes to even know it’s turning over. \n \nWhat’s it like not to drive? \nThis is a new section of our reviews that will likely become increasingly common in the coming years. The S-class facelift is a Level-2 autonomous vehicle, and interestingly, Mercedes has finally managed to provide (most of) its radar-based safety and driver assistance systems in India. These range from the cool but established automatic parking, all the way up to full-on self-driving, albeit for a limited time and highly dependent on the road conditions. Sure, Volvo was the first to bring such tech to India, but better late than never, right? \n \nIt’s all possible thanks to five radar sensors (two front, three rear), 12 ultrasonic sensors, a pair of stereo cameras and a light sensor in the windscreen, and four actual cameras that provide a 360-degree view of the car. Distronic or radar-guided cruise control lets you set a distance to the car in front and maintain it as speeds rise and fall. Active Braking Assist will warn you first, then prime the brakes, then actually brake if a vehicle stops in front of you. Blind Spot and Lane Keeping Assists warn you of cars approaching from the sides and will even brake the far-side wheels to steer you away from someone who gets too close. And finally Active Steering Assist, which will steer the car within a set of white lines for limited amounts of time; in the absence of white lines, it can be set to follow a car ahead, provided it doesn’t steer more than 21 degrees and doesn’t make any sudden manoeuvres. Put that all together and you get Level 2 Autonomy, but as we said before, it only works if the road markings are legible. It can be easily thrown off by anomalies such as erratic traffic and pedestrians or animals, all of which we have in abundance in India. So use it with caution. \n  \nWe tried it in various situations on our drive and got mixed results. For example, on Hyderabad’s well-maintained Outer Ring Road (ORR) it worked spectacularly, following the road around bends at a pre-set speed, without any steering or pedal input, slowing down and speeding up with the traffic. But on smaller roads where the lane markers had faded and traffic was a bit more unruly, the systems frequently shut off as the conditions were no longer met. Also, when the lines aren’t clear, the car can weave disconcertingly until it ‘finds its bearings’ using a car in front, or the divider on the right. \n \nShould I buy one? \nThe six-cylinder petrol S-class isn’t typically a strong seller, with an overwhelming majority of buyers sticking with diesel. This is also the reason Mercedes didn’t rush to bring the new-generation straight-six petrol to India and stuck with a revamp of the old V6, focusing its budgets and energies on the all-new straight-six diesel engine instead. A lot of buyers in the market looking for a petrol will also choose to upgrade to the V8-powered Maybach S-class, but while before its facelift, the price difference was a lot smaller, the jump will now cost you Rs 57 lakh! Combine this with all the new tech you get in the standard S 450 and it starts to look like better value now. Sure, you won’t get the fuel economy of the diesel, and you won’t get the more lavish, stretched cabin of the Maybach, but the V6 petrol is more refined and better performing than the diesel, and a lot more affordable than the V8 petrol. So, while it may still not be the most popular S-class to buy, it now has a lot more going for it than its predecessor."}

Scott Walker and MillerCoors both balked at President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs, particularly those on aluminum. \n\nTrump on Thursday said that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. The action would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. \n\nToday, Walker issued a statement asking Trump to reconsider the potential tariff on aluminum, arguing it could cost jobs. \n\n“If the President wants to protect good-paying, family-supporting jobs in America, especially here in Wisconsin, then he should reconsider the administration’s position on these tariffs, particularly on ultra-thin aluminum,” Walker said. “As I described to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross last year, there is not a market in America that can support the demand for ultra-thin aluminum for employers here in Wisconsin and across the country.” \n\nIn a series of tweets Thursday, brewing giant MillerCoors said it was disappointed in the decision and said “it is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. \n\n“We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available, however, there simply isn’t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us. American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of this misguided tariff,” MillerCoors tweeted. \n\nThe brewer has upwards of 1,400 employees in Milwaukee. \n\n‘Ironically, American companies who will feel the negative impact of the tariffs can actually move their operations to another country, such as Canada, and not face new tariffs on the sale of their products. This scenario would lead to the exact opposite outcome of the administration’s stated objective, which is to protect American jobs,” Walker said. \n\nTrump’s plans also drew criticism from U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, who called them “concerning” and House Speaker Paul Ryan. A Ryan spokesman said the speaker hoped Trump would look at other approaches, according to The Hill. "}

However, when it comes time to managing contractors, including foodservice, many healthcare facilities fall into the habit of allowing their agreement to roll over year after year without any type of competitive bid or meaningful review that could identify areas for improvement,” said Peter Cayan, R.D., vice president, supply chain and nutrition consulting. “Our service helps to optimize your contracted foodservice management agreement through a review of your current contractor costs compared to national benchmarks, a legal review of the terms and conditions of the agreement, and strategic direction to ensure your needs and expectations are fully met.” \n \nDrinker Biddle’s healthcare team has several attorneys with significant experience negotiating foodservice and other types of outsourcing contracts for healthcare clients.

At the conclusion of the audit and analysis, Drinker Biddle will provide each client with a formalized report that includes recommendations on ways to optimize the business and legal terms in the client’s current foodservice management agreement. \n \nIn addition to the benchmarking and cost reduction benefits, the audit process also assists facilities in aligning foodservice management operational performance objectives as well as patient satisfaction, quality and other key performance indicators. \n \nCayan explained that providers can use the results to renegotiate existing foodservice management agreements with their current contractors even before they are up for renewal or create a request for proposal (RFP). \n \nThe addition of Drinker Biddle is an integral part of Intalere’s Nutrition Consulting Solutions team engagement. Intalere’s Consulting Services team will facilitate a peer-to-peer assessment in your organization in the following six food system areas: \n\n     Organization and staffing.      Contract audit and analysis.      Financial reporting, resource utilization and controls.      Retail and patient foodservices.      Safety and sanitation.      Clinical nutrition services.   \nAbout Intalere \nIntalere’s mission focuses on elevating the operational health of America’s healthcare providers by designing tailored, smart solutions that deliver optimal cost, quality and clinical outcomes.

{"articleID":33453276366,"title":"VMWare, Inc. Stock Is STILL Far Too Risky to Own","content":"VMWare, Inc. (NYSE: VMW ) beat earnings expectations. Now, the virtualization company faces a conundrum as the completion of its takeover by Dell Inc  looms. A merger creates uncertainty for VMWare stock, which has nearly tripled in the last two years. How VMW will integrate into the privately held Dell after a merger remains unclear. Given merger uncertainty, investors should look to how VMWare combines with Dell before taking a position in the stock. \n \nDespite merger concerns, the company reported great news on the earnings front. Q4 EPS came in at $1.68-per-share, beating earnings expectations by 6-cents-per-share. This compares to the $1.43-per-share reported in Q4 2016. However, this figure excludes a one-time, non-cash tax charge of $970 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Including the tax charge, earnings came in at a $1.04-per-share loss. \n \nRevenues of $2.31 billion beat estimates by $50 million; revenues also rose 13.8% on a year-over-year basis. License revenue claimed $1.07 billion of revenues and increased 20% from year-ago levels. Full-year revenues came in at $7.92 billion, of which $3.19 billion came from licenses. Non-GAAP annual income was $5.19-per-share, which is up from $4.39-per-share in 2016 and higher than the expected $5.14-per-share. \n \nThe company also raised guidance as it expects fiscal 2019 to bring $6.02-per-share on revenue of $8.73 billion. Analysts had predicted $5.59-per-share with revenues of $8.64 billion. \n Dell Merger Looms Too Heavily Over VMWare Stock  \nThe California-based company provides cloud computing and platform visualization software and associated services. Dell (which should not be confused with the VMWare-tracking stock Dell Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: DVMT )) owns an 80% stake in VMWare. \n \nDell is focused on a “reverse merger.” In this deal, Dell would buy the remaining 20% of VMWare and take the combined company public. Still, DVMT stock rose on the news as a merger would mean a buyout of the tracking stock. Report of this merger took VMW stock down. Many investors fear a takeover by Dell due to a high level of indebtedness. \n \nVMWare specializes in software virtualization. This allows one PC or server to perform the work of multiple machines by mimicking their behavior. Like with its peer Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), licensing this software has been particularly lucrative as licensing revenue growth has exceeded overall revenue growth for VMWare. \n \nThis popular software has served as a boon to VMWare stock. The equity, which traded below $44-per-share two years ago, now trades well over $122-per-share. This is even after a somewhat negative reaction to the earnings report. \n \nI love their product, and I think VMWare has a bright future with or without a Dell merger. However, with the stock price increases over the last two years, it trades at a fair valuation. And with the now-private Dell combining with the company, the financials of the full company remain unknown. Moreover, with its 6% drop right before the company announced earnings, and its falling even further after the next day’s trading, investors have not taken the merger news well. Hence, staying away from VMWare stock might stand as a prudent move for now. \n The Bottom Line on VMWare Stock  \nVMW stock has shown impressive growth. However, with the uncertainty coming from a Dell merger, investors should move to the sidelines. \n \nVMW beat both quarterly and annual earnings estimates as its virtualization success and increased licensing revenue have impressed investors. But news of a complete takeover by Dell sent the stock reeling in trading the next day. Dell carries a heavy debt load. Moreover, since the company remains private, details of its financial situation remain beyond the view of outside investors. With this level of uncertainty, it’s time to move to the sidelines on VMWare stock. \n \nAs of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks."}

Among the distinguished guests joining Dietmar Exler, MBUSA president and CEO, were Nathan Deal, Governor of Georgia; Keisha Lance Bottoms, Mayor of Atlanta; Axel Harries, Daimler vice president sales Mercedes-Benz Cars and product management Mercedes-Benz Passenger Cars; and Rusty Paul, Mayor of Sandy Springs.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: (Graphic: Business Wire) “All the stars are aligned. Our new Atlanta headquarters marks a highpoint for Mercedes-Benz in the U.S. market,” said Dietmar Exler, president and CEO of MBUSA. “Not just in terms of being the leading luxury brand in the U.S. for the past two years, but also in terms of this building which is designed from the inside out to enable a creative, innovative and empowered workforce more representative of a start-up than a conventional corporation.”\n\nBuilding designed from the inside out \n\nThe 200,000 square-foot building, located on a 12-acre campus near Georgia 400, at the intersection of Mercedes-Benz Drive (formerly Barfield Road) and Abernathy Road, is made entirely of glass that is supported by a steel structure. Glass, which runs the full length of the building, was chosen as the exterior material because of the sleek, modern aesthetic and transparency enabling employees to enjoy natural daylight anywhere in the building.\n\nThe building was designed from the inside out and entirely purpose-built around the way employees utilize the space. As an environment oriented around encouraging interaction and creativity, the workplace has a 1:1 ratio of collaborative seating and individual workstations.\n\nThe building itself is divided into North and South Work Bars that are joined by a spacious indoor Atrium, which is the heart of the building. On the second and third floor, the Work Bars are joined by corridors called Bridges. The building also includes a conference center, a coffee bar with its own barista, a restaurant-quality café that emphasizes locally sourced ingredients, a 5,000 square foot fitness center with trainers, an on-site child care facility with four classrooms and an outdoor playground and a furnished roof deck for outdoor collaboration space.\n\nThe headquarters building incorporates environmentally-friendly features such as water reduction using drip irrigation and energy efficient mechanical systems to target LEED Silver Certification. In the interest of eliminating food waste, the company is partnering with Second Helpings Atlanta Inc. , which rescues surplus food from Metro Atlanta organizations and delivers to those in need. To align with the company’s commitment to sustainability, MBUSA is implementing several alternative transportation initiatives including flex scheduling to reduce the traffic impact, a dedicated MARTA shuttle for employees, bike racks, as well as electric vehicle charging stations. \n\nConstruction of the new headquarters took 425,000 man hours and more than 1,000 workers. The building consists of 14,000 cubic yards of concrete, 1,500 tons of steel and 1.6 acres of glass. More than 780 trees have been planted, and a nature trail encircles the building to provide an outdoor campus feel.\n\n“What a beautiful building this is! It’s hard to top the seal of approval from the world to have Mercedes-Benz choose Georgia as its headquarters,” said Governor Nathan Deal. “Your service projects in the community have made you great neighbors, and we appreciate the Southern hospitality.”\n\nLab1886 Atlanta \n\nDuring the ceremony, Axel Harries announced Daimler’s intention to establish a global incubator-type entity called Lab1886 in Atlanta. Lab1886 will help drive innovation by combining a big corporation’s expertise and know-how with the spirit of a startup. The Atlanta entity will open in the summer of 2018 and joins three existing locations in Beijing, Berlin and Stuttgart.\n\n“In the last few years, we have watched Atlanta carefully: excellent colleges and universities are offering highly skilled and motivated graduates, and more and more innovative technology and digital companies make their home here. Atlanta is a true city of the future – a perfect match for Mercedes-Benz,” said Harries. “We will build the fourth Lab1886 opening here in Atlanta this summer.”\n\nUnwavering commitment to innovation and community \n\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms expressed excitement about the new headquarters as well as the Lab1886 announcement saying, “We are excited about what’s coming to Atlanta very, very soon.” She expressed enthusiasm for the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta and the company’s investments on the Westside, adding, “The partnerships between the corporation, nonprofits and government here in the city are incomparable.”\n\nAside from its impact on the economy of Atlanta and the state of Georgia, the company has made itself well known in the community for its efforts to educate and empower the next generation. MBUSA is involved with over 50 organizations in its effort to address local needs in the community, including Atlanta’s Westside, the fast-developing area surrounding the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. “It’s an exciting day for us,” said Sandy Springs Mayor Rusty Paul. “You’ve been great partners to our community already.”\n\nAbout Mercedes-Benz USA Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA), headquartered in Atlanta, is responsible for the distribution, marketing and customer service for all Mercedes-Benz products in the United States. MBUSA offers drivers the most diverse lineup in the luxury segment with 15 model lines ranging from the sporty CLA-Class four-door coupe to the flagship S-Class and the Mercedes-AMG GT R.\n\nMBUSA is also responsible for Mercedes-Benz Vans and smart products in the U.S. More information on MBUSA and its products can be found at , and .

Nokia 9 is expected to be the first flagship phone from Noki \n  \nNokia unveiled as many as five devices at MWC 2018. HMD Global-owned company launched Nokia 7 Plus and 8 Sirocco as new devices while the Banana Phone is a throwback. However, Nokia did not launch any Snapdragon 845 phones at the event. Nokia 9 is expected to be the first flagship phone from Nokia with Snapdragon 845 this year. \n \nNokia 9 has been rumoured for quite some time now. The phone is expected to arrive late this year. The smartphone has been making headlines for its rumoured iPhone-X like notch. New concept renders of Nokia 9 shows what the phone could look like. \n \nWhat takes the notice first is the notch. Just like OnePlus 6 and Vivo V9, Nokia 9 is also rumoured to join the iPhone X-like notch bandwagon. Reports of Nokia 9 with notch started pouring in more after Google unveiled its Android P developer preview that offers provisions create apps that would be compatible with display 'cut out'. \n \nThe notch in the picture resembles Asus Zenfone 5 notch and contains two selfie cameras, a proximity sensor and a speaker grille. The phone appears nearly-bezel-less with a small bezel at the bottom of the phone. Although the lower bezel has also been reduced to minimum and is imprinted with brand name Nokia. \n \nThe second-big rumour about Nokia 9 is that the phone could come with in-display fingerprint technology. The technology has been rumoured for several other phones before like iPhone X and Galaxy S9 but apparently the technology incurs a huge amount of money and Nokia might not want to put this feature in Nokia 9 as it would increase the price of the phone. \n \nNokia 9 is expected to come with Snapdragon 845 and compete with the likes of iPhone X and Galaxy Note series. The phone is rumoured to come with a 3,250mAh battery, sport a 5.5-inch OLED display manufactured by LG, dual cameras on front and back and pack in 128GB of internal storage. \n \nThe Nokia 9 is tipped to come in two storage variants, one with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage and the other with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The phone could come with a price tag of around CNY 3,699 (approx. Rs 36,000) for the 64GB variant and CNY 4,199 (approx. Rs 40,800) for the 128GB variant. \n \nALSO READ : Nokia 9: Expected features, price, rumours, everything else we know so far \n \n[embedded content]"}

How do we make sure that the U.S. wins this global race? \n \nHere’s how. \n \nWe empower the competitive U.S. wireless industry. This is not only the American way, it is the wireless way. Innovators in the U.S. created the first mobile phone, the iPhone, global leading 1G to 4G networks, and are ready to do it again for 5G. \n \nThe U.S. benefits from four national wireless providers and dozens more regional providers that have invested over $200 billion in private capital to build today’s leading wireless networks. Americans benefit from ever improving services (19% faster last year), and falling prices (11% lower). As a nation, we need to leverage this competitive drive and technical know-how once again. \n \nThe wireless industry has spent the last decade connecting everyone. Now, we are preparing to connect everything to 5G. 5G networks will be 100 times faster, and support 100 times more devices. \n  \n  \nIt will also unlock real-time applications that will transform American lives and industries. Imagine specialists in New York performing surgery on patients in rural Texas, and wireless sensors monitoring and rerouting traffic to cut commuting times and lower emissions. 5G will stimulate entrepreneurialism and innovation on an unprecedented scale. \n \nThe great news is that U.S. industry is already investing with trials across the country, and 5G deployments will start in some communities this year. We have seen major announcements from all four national operators. In all, the wireless industry will invest $275 billion of its own money to build next-generation secure wireless networks, according to Accenture. This will create more than 3 million new jobs, and add $500 billion to our economy. \n \nWe don’t need government to build the networks. We do need government support to effectively marshal key resources - spectrum and rights of way - to advance this national priority. 5G networks will require hundreds of new MHz of spectrum, much of it currently controlled by the federal government. \n \nWe have seen concrete steps from policymakers in recent days demonstrating that the U.S. government is ready to meet the global challenge. \n \nOn spectrum, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai also scheduled a new auction for November. The Administration also identified new spectrum for future mobile broadband use, and bipartisan leaders in Congress agreed to key spectrum reforms. \n \nSimilarly, it currently takes too long and costs too much to deploy new wireless infrastructure. Today, federal, state and local governments have a maze of duplicative, lengthy regulations that slow the deployment of new networks. We need to modernize siting and zoning rules associated with wireless deployment. \n \n5G networks will rely on new small cell antennae about the size of a small pizza box. It can take less than an hour to install a small cell on a street light, but too often takes over a year to navigate the paperwork and bureaucracy associated with securing approval. Fourteen states have already acted to set clear timelines and cost-based rates, and we need more. The leadership at the FCC, in state houses, and in Congress should move forward now on a package of sensible wireless infrastructure reforms to reduce the time and cost to deploy 5G. \n \nHere again, we have seen some good forward momentum in recent days. \n \nFCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has put forward a common sense plan to address siting delays and costs associated with federal environmental and historic preservation rules. We urge the FCC to vote in support of his infrastructure modernization proposals because they will help drive greater investment and ensure more Americans benefit from 5G. \n \nWe need a similar focus on local zoning challenges - from every level of government - to really jumpstart investment. New Mexico’s governor recently signed legislation doing just that, and Congress agreed to reform making siting easier on federal lands. \n \nThe 5G race is too important not to win. We need to ensure that tomorrow’s advancements in health care, transportation, and energy are not exported overseas by ceding the platform for 21st century innovation to others. The Chinese understand that to control 5G is to capture new jobs, billions in economic growth, and the technical dominance that will have critical national security implications for years to come. \n \nUltimately, to lead the world in wireless, we will need more auctions announced, additional spectrum allocated for future wireless use, and greater siting reform at all levels. After the recent show of strong leadership, I’m confident we will have more good weeks ahead and the U.S. wireless industry will continue to lead the world in wireless. \n \nMeredith Attwell Baker joined CTIA as its President and CEO in June 2014.

{"articleID":33666371846,"title":"Report: Macro-less Word Document Attacks on the Rise, Zero Day Malware Variants Jump 167 Percent","content":"SEATTLE, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WatchGuard® Technologies, a leader in advanced network security solutions, today announced new research findings from its Internet Security Report for Q4 2017. Among the report's most notable findings, threat intelligence from Firebox appliances protecting small and midsize businesses (SMBs) and distributed enterprises around the world showed that total malware attacks are up by 33 percent, and that cyber criminals are increasingly leveraging Microsoft Office documents to deliver malicious payloads. WatchGuard has also launched a new Threat Landscape data visualization tool, available for the public to access to daily updates about the most prevalent computer and network security threats affecting SMBs and distributed enterprises. \"After a full year of collecting and analyzing Firebox Feed data, we can clearly see that cyber criminals are continuing to leverage sophisticated, evasive attacks and resourceful malware delivery schemes to steal valuable data,\" said Corey Nachreiner, chief technology officer at WatchGuard Technologies. \"Although these criminal tactics may vary over time, we can be certain that this broad trend will persist, so the risks have never been greater for small and midsize organizations with less IT and security resources. We encourage businesses of all sizes to proactively mitigate these threats with layered security services, advanced malware protection, and employee education and training in security best practices.\" \n\nWatchGuard's Internet Security Report provides a quarterly update on the most ubiquitous security threats targeting businesses today, as well key strategies they can use to protect employees, customers and stakeholders from data theft. The top takeaways from the Q4 2017 report include:\n\nCyber criminals leveraged malicious Office documents to trick victims. Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) attacks cracked WatchGuard's top ten malware list in Q4, as hackers increasingly exploited issues within this Microsoft Office standard to execute code. Also called \"macro-less malware,\" these malicious documents often use PowerShell and obfuscated script to get past network defenses. Additionally, two of the top-ten network attacks in Q4 involved Microsoft Office exploits, further emphasizing the growing trend of malicious document attacks. Overall malware attacks grew significantly, while zero day malware variants jumped 167 percent. WatchGuard Fireboxes blocked over 30 million total malware variants in Q4, which was a 33 percent increase over the previous quarter. Out of the total threats prevented in Q4, the subset of new or \"zero day\" malware instances rose steeply by 167 percent compared to Q3. These increases can likely be attributed to heightened criminal activity during the holiday season. Nearly half of all malware eluded basic antivirus (AV) solutions. WatchGuard Fireboxes block malware using both legacy signature-based detection techniques and the modern, proactive behavioral detection solution – APT Blocker. When APT Blocker catches a malware variant, it means the legacy AV signatures missed it. This zero day malware accounted for 46 percent of all malware in Q4. That level of growth suggests criminals are using more sophisticated evasion techniques capable of slipping attacks past traditional AV services, which further underscores the importance of behavior-based defenses. Scripting attacks account for 48 percent of top malware. Script-based attacks caught by signatures for JavaScript and Visual Basic Script threats, such as downloaders and droppers, accounted for the majority of malware detected in Q4. Users should take note of the continued popularity of these attacks and watch out for malicious script in web pages and email attachments of any kind. \n\nThe full Internet Security Report features evaluations of the quarter's most pervasive malware and network attacks, recommendations for useful defensive strategies in today's threat landscape, and a detailed breakdown of \"the Krack Attack\" – one of the top information security issues in 2017. \n\nAdditionally, the report includes a new research project from the WatchGuard Threat Lab, which analyzes a database of more than 1 billion stolen password records to stress just how often users choose weak passwords and re-use credentials across multiple accounts. This quarter's conclusions are based on anonymized Firebox Feed data from nearly 40,000 active WatchGuard Fireboxes worldwide, which blocked more than 30 million malware variants (783 per device) and 6.9 million network attacks (178 per device) in Q4 2017. \n\nNew Threat Landscape Data Visualization Tool\n\nWatchGuard's new Threat Landscape data visualization tool offers daily security insights regarding the top malware and network attacks around the globe. The Threat Landscape page enables users to search Firebox Feed data a by type of attack, region or country, and targeted date ranges, with interactive graphics that are updated instantly and easy to read. \n\nFor more information, download the full report here.

It is extremely important for CFM, Safran and General Electric, which is our partner in this joint venture. We have to produce 340 engines even if it is over a long period of time, it is something extremely exciting for a company like ours,\" said Safran Group CEO and Director Philippe Petitcolin. \n \nSpeaking soon after signing the pact with SpiceJet, he also said that India is a growing country in terms of commercial aerospace market. \n \nIndian carriers have substantial orders for new aircraft as they embark on ambitious expansion plans amid growing demand in the domestic aviation space. They are likely to induct more than 900 aircraft in the coming years. \n \nTo a query on whether Safran expects more deals like that of with SpiceJet, Petitcolin replied in the affirmative. \n \n\"Yes of course. India is a growing country in terms of commercial aerospace market. You have a growth in the range of 17 per cent a year. We need more and more aeroplanes. We are one of the two leaders (in engine manufacturing) in the world. We have a market share of over 70 per cent in the short medium range aircraft segment. We wish to have a better and higher market share in India,\" he said. \n \nSpiceJet and Safran Group have now finalised the purchase of LEAP-1B engines to power a total of 155 Boeing 737 MAX planes along with spare engines to support the fleet. The deal was inked at the Indo-French Economic Partnership signing ceremony on Saturday on the occasion of French President Emmanuel Macron visit to India. \n \nCFM engines are manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture between Safran and General Electric. \n \nThe airline has also signed a ten-year Rate per Flight Hour (RPFH) agreement with CFM Services that covers all LEAP-1B engines powering SpiceJet's 737 MAX planes. \n \nRPFH agreements are part of CFM's portfolio of flexible aftermarket support offerings. \n \nUnder the terms of the agreement, CFM guarantees maintenance costs for all SpiceJet's LEAP-1B engines on a pay by hour basis. \n \nAccording to Safran India's website, more than 1,000 CFM 56 and LEAP engines are in service.

In 1959, ARPA, as it was then known, was instrumental in the development of the Transit (also called NavSat) satellite positioning system, a predecessor to today’s widely adopted GPS. \n \nToday, the US military is dependent on large, complex satellites in geostationary earth orbits for a variety of communication and information-gathering functions. However, with China, Russia, and others progressing rapidly with their own military space programmes, it has become clear that the these large satellites have become vulnerable \n \nSpeaking to reporters at a breakfast meeting last month, DARPA director, Steven Walker, said DARPA predicted this issue a number of years ago, and had explained to senior leadership all the way to the White House that “space was changing, that things were getting very contested and that the US needed some programs to counter it.” \n \nHis view is that the US military should move away from the current expensive geostationary satellite system and instead focus future efforts on creating constellations of dozens or hundreds of small satellites in low earth orbit, which would prove much more difficult for enemies to destroy. \n \nThe other benefit of using cheaper and lighter smaller satellites is that it gives the US military the chance to leverage the competition in the private sector, a plan that DARPA has dubbed “ Blackjack “. \n \nThe emergence of companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX in recent years has resulted in the cost of launching small payloads into space plummet to under $4,000 per kg with SpaceX’s reusable Falcon Heavy rocket . However, launch cost is only one part of the puzzle, and DARPA’s Blackjack strategy also calls on the private sector for further innovations in the production of “low cost, mass-reproducible, space payloads and commoditized satellite buses” that offer “economies of scale previously unavailable”. \n \nThe agency envisions the total cost of manufacturing and launching these new-breed of satellites into orbit as under $6 million. This competitive pricing would offer them the ability to launch a sufficient number to create constellations to provide global persistent coverage for less than the cost of a single vulnerable geostationary satellite today."}

The company told those employees that many of them would be losing their jobs as of July.  Whole Foods, now owned by Amazon , has been centralizing several roles in a push to cut costs. The moves have at times bothered employees, customers , and s  uppliers.  \nWhole Foods is slashing regional and in-store marketing and graphic design jobs in its latest push to centralize operations, people with knowledge of the matter told Business Insider. \n\nThe company currently employs graphic-designers who create signage used in the stores to highlight local products and prices. The positions, along with several corporate marketing roles, are being eliminated, the people said, asking not to be identified. Some employees were told they'd have until July 2, and continue to receive benefits until the end of that month. \n\nIt's not clear exactly how many jobs will be affected but the company operates about 450 stores in the United States, in addition to 11 regional offices. About 10 positions are being eliminated from each regional office, the person said. \n\nEmployees were told that the move is being made because Whole Foods wants to \"centralize\" certain jobs and have regional and global teams to handle jobs that can be done outside the store. In-store marketing staff and regional marketing coordinators will have to re-interview for jobs at the regional office, employees were told on a conference call on Thursday. \n\nA profile of one of the graphic designers, posted on Whole Foods website, describes the role this way: \n\n\"We create a variety of hand drawn chalkboards that help define many Whole Foods Market stores. And my title means many things, but essentially I'm responsible for those chalkboards as well as the accuracy of item/pricing signage, maintenance of the associated databases and the creation, upkeep and distribution of all advertising and in-store marketing collateral.\" \n\nWhole Foods didn't reply to requests for comment on the moves. The company has been moving away from its localized approach in the past year, shifting other roles to its Austin headquarters and changing its supply chain and inventory methods in order to cut costs. \n\nThose moves have angered some employees, suppliers, and customers, as they've left stores without inventory or conflicted with the \"local\" ethos that Whole Foods had come to be known for."}

{"articleID":33561747170,"title":"RSA Security director dissects identity & access management industry","content":"The Gartner Identity & Access Management Summit recently took place in London where I had the chance to speak with RSA Security identity governance and lifecycle director Steve Mowll. \n \nAs well as emerging technologies in the industry, Mowll spoke about the future, the implications of GDPR, and strategies that businesses can use to overcome the challenges to security that are emerging as a result of the rapid adoption of cloud computing. \n Current trends in the industry  \nBlockchain was a major topic of discussion at the Summit and Mowll says it has a lot of potential to solve problems like identity proofing and dynamic access management. \n \n“However, after two years of talk in the identity industry, it has yet to be adopted into any ‘live’ mainstream use, apart from its original use in cryptocurrency,” says Mowll. \n \n“With the improvements in mobile tech, biometrics are becoming a much more popular and convenient option for authentication, and many companies and vendors have adopted it as a way to move away from the password. By allowing the private biometric data to reside on the user’s own device, mobile biometric authentication often removes the burden of having to manage and secure this personally-identifiable data, allaying privacy concerns.” \n \nMowll says analytics is also playing a huge role within authentication and identity governance and administration processes, helping to improve the decision-making process for organisations. \n \n“These analytics are also starting to combine data from other IT Security technologies such as user activity information from the SIEM, and third party and application risk data from the GRC platform. This will help businesses to better understand what they need to do to reduce risk not just in terms of identity, but for the organisation as a whole,” says Mowll. \n \n“These increased analytical capabilities will also allow Identity processes to become more convenient for end users. Currently, the pain of identity management within enterprise organisations continues to be felt – whether it’s new users not having the access they need when they start a new job, or risk professionals having to review thousands of accesses with no real context. Identity & Risk Analytics will soon reduce, and in some cases completely remove, these pains, and let the business get on with their day job.” \n Centralised technologies for the future  \nMowll believes centralised services that collect identity data points to understand identity risk in a broader context will transform the identity management industry in the future by sharing data across the whole IT security ecosystem with governance, risk and compliance. \n \n“Using insights – from threat detection to user behaviour analytics and privileged access management – these technologies can reduce the friction within business processes (such as access request and approval, recertification and authentication), while also providing a greatly enhanced understanding of identity risk to these security functions,” says Mowll. \n GDPR  \nMowll says who has access to what and determining whether access is appropriate has been a requirement of many regulations and standards throughout the years. \n \n“GDPR will increase the scope of applications needing identity governance to include applications holding personal data,” says Mowll. \n \n“Data access governance will also become more important as companies look to understand where personal data exists in their unstructured data environments and determine who has access to it. For these reasons GDPR will continue to increase the value of identity & access management as part of an organisation’s IT security practices.” \n Tips for overcoming challenges  \nMowll says businesses can overcome the challenges presented by third party cloud apps by demanding standard interfaces throughout identity and access management practices. \n \nWhile authentication standards such as SAML are common across cloud platforms, corresponding standards for access management are not,” says Mowll. \n \n“Many identity professionals talk about simple cloud identity management, but the reality is that many cloud services do not do not support it. This means while you can get your users onto the service, the way you manage their access is different with every vendor.” \n   Interested in this topic? \nWe can put you in touch with an expert."}

The highest trust rating was observed in China (70%), while the UK and Australia were tied for the lowest rating (31%). \n\nRetail investors were asked about the importance of seven specific actions investment firms could take to build up trust, as well as how satisfied they were in those aspects. Among those, the most important were the full disclosure of fees and other costs (84%) and the presence of reliable security measures to protect data (84%); investors were slightly less satisfied when it came to fee disclosures (48%) than they were with data security measures (55%). \n\nThe other actions the survey asked about were: \n\nBeing forthright about disclosing and managing conflicts of interest (80%); \n\nProviding easy-to-understand investment reports (80%); \n\nGenerating returns similar to or above a target benchmark (78%); \n\nCharging fees that reflect the value clients get from the relationship (74%); and \n\nEmploys investment professionals with credentials from respected industry organizations (73%) \n\nWhether they’re dealing with a person or a business, retail investors don’t grant their trust. From those surveyed, 46% said their trust has to be constantly earned and maintained over time. That’s compared to only 29% that said they give the benefit of the doubt once the other party shows they can be trusted, and just 24% who assume the other party is trustworthy by default. \n\nAnd while a lot has been said about retail investors’ sensitivity to fees, only 28% of those polled said they’d leave their investment manager over fee increases. Instead, 47% cited underperformance; 43% referred to lack of communication/responsiveness; 40% pointed at data/confidentiality breaches; and 26% talked about the departure of their financial advisor from his/her current firm. \n\nTechnology was also a factor in augmenting trust, though its added value differed across varying age groups. Among respondents aged 25 to 34, 70% said increased use of technology has led them to trust their advisor more; that number decreased among the 35 to 44 (54%); 45 to 44 (33%); 55 to 64 (26%); and 65+ (18%) age brackets."}

For the first time, YouTube TV will also partner with MLB on a brand-new season-long sponsorship – “First Pitch” – that will bring to life the YouTube TV brand during the first pitches of games on MLB Network and MLB.tv, and will be amplified on MLB.com and MLB social channels. YouTube TV plans to once again incorporate MLB players in its promotional efforts throughout the multi-year deal, which will also include a variety of national TV spots and on-air call-outs during the games, branding across MLB’s digital properties and official social media accounts, and in-stadium promotion. \n \nThe extended partnership also offers expanded baseball coverage to all YouTube TV members with the addition of the award-winning MLB Network to its channel lineup starting today. In the future, YouTube TV members will also be able to add MLB.tv, the longest running sports streaming service in the U.S., for an additional fee. \n \n“YouTube brought tremendous creativity, marketing energy and innovation to the most exciting part of our year, the Postseason and World Series,” says Noah Garden , MLB executive vice president, commerce. \n \n“Their engagement with our young fans, rising stars and clubs showed that YouTube TV is a natural partner for our sport and we’re proud to build on this groundbreaking relationship.

This included the first-ever presenting sponsorship of the World Series, TV ads that incorporated live footage, six-second spots with current MLB stars on YouTube and TV, exclusive baseball content from YouTube’s highly popular creators and player support across social media. The integrated marketing campaign’s success throughout October led YouTube and MLB to extend and broaden the World Series partnership for an additional two years. \n \n“Our historic partnership with MLB was a first of its kind.

The news comes as Australia’s Crime Stoppers announces  a new partnership with Kaspersky Lab. \n \nReported earlier  today , Kaspersky is opening a new Swiss data centre, and continues to reject allegations the Russian government uses its software to spy on customers. \n \nLast year, several American and British government agencies removed Kaspersky products from their networks, citing national security concerns. \n \nAmerica’s Homeland Security has since banned using Kaspersky products. \n \n\n \nDespite this, the Chief of Kaspersky Labs remains  reportedly  unphased, stating his company’s products weren’t extensively used by the US government in the first place. \n \nPartnering with Crime Stoppers, Kaspersky Labs will provide online cyber-safety education to the Australian public. \n \nCrime Stoppers assists Australia’s Police by allowing members of the public to report criminal information. \n \nPeter Price, Crime Stoppers’ Director, states   cybercrime reporting has jumped in the past two years, with 30% of reports now lodged online. \n \nMr Price claims  the partnership will better enable the agency to combat cybercrime, as nearly 90% of offences occur internationally: \n \n“Hence the importance for us to get on the front foot and do as much prevention education as possible” \n \n“What better way than to collaborate with a business whose very nature in itself is stopping crime. We feel that Kasperksy Lab can have an impact in keeping Australians safe”. \n \n\n \nIn its submission  to the Australian government, Kaspersky asserts the need for mutual third-party trust in the cybersecurity industry: \n \n“‘Localising’ or ‘regionalising’ cybersecurity regulation does little to help Australian enterprises to gain a share of the global $93 billion information security market projected for 2018 by Gartner or the growing $22 billion market of industrial cybersecurity.” \n \n“The breakthrough technologies driving this market – such as AI and machine learning – require access to large troves of historical threat data from across the globe to develop efficient threat detection and prediction models.” \n \n\n \n“We strongly believe that cybersecurity industry needs to address the question of trust with more robust criteria than the geographic location of company’s headquarters – be it Melbourne or Moscow.” \n \nAccording to ZDNet , Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security, Angus Taylor, affirms attribution is important, and action must be taken: \n \n“You’re saying to that country, you’re calling out bad behaviour and these things can always escalate – making them accountable” \n \n“Holding criminals and hostile governments to account… diplomats have to manage those issues very carefully because these things can escalate, but I am adamant we should attribute.”"}

(PRWEB)  March 05, 2018 \n \nHonoring the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr. and his service to others, Novant Health is launching a unique leadership program called the H: Drive Experience; the “H” represents “hidden.” The pilot program aims to identify untapped, high-potential leaders who are invested and engaged in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg community but who might not otherwise have access to leadership development opportunities. \n \n“At Novant Health, diversity and inclusion are more than just words. They’re core values,” said Tanya Blackmon, executive vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer, Novant Health. “We are proud to provide a leadership development opportunity through the H: Drive Experience that will further benefit our diverse communities.” \n \nThrough a combination of core sessions, coaching, interaction with community leaders and shared group experiences, prominent change agents in the community will facilitate personal and leadership development designed to help participants create a clearer sense of purpose, strengthen their leadership voice and deepen their commitment to serve. \n \nKey findings from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Opportunity Task Force report revealed that social capital serves as a key differentiator essential to creating greater access to opportunity in our communities, which are largely divided by race and income. Conversations about how the arts could be leveraged to engage individuals in dialogue to better our community inspired Blackmon, Arlene Ferebee, senior director of strategic development, Novant Health, and Toussaint Romain, assistant public defender, Mecklenburg Public Defender’s Office, to develop the idea for the H: Drive Experience. \n \nThey sought community knowledge from several experts, including Ophelia Garmon-Brown, MD, senior vice president for community wellness and education, Novant Health; Mike Whitehead, founder, The Center for Intentional Leadership; Jon Davis, consultant, The Center for Intentional Leadership; Octavia Seawell, principal, OZS Consulting; and Christian A. Friend, PhD, president, C.A. Friend Consulting. These individuals will provide resources to help participants reach their full leadership potential. Additionally, Diane Gavarkavich, director of research services, UNC Charlotte Urban Institute, will provide program evaluation support. \n \nThe nine-month program will begin in May 2018 and end in January 2019. Participants will be asked to make a firm commitment to attend the scheduled sessions and invest in their personal development.

Braun, (520) 529-4614, sgwtp66@gmail.com  \nU.S. Wildlife Agency Promises Gunnison Sage Grouse Recovery Plan \n \nRare Bird Threatened by Drilling, Sprawl, Livestock Grazing in Utah, Colorado \n \nGUNNISON, Colo. — Four conservation groups reached an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today to stay legal action while the agency prepares a recovery plan for the Gunnison sage grouse, a critically imperiled bird in Colorado and Utah known for its elaborate courtship rituals. \n \nThe coalition’s lawsuit argued the grouse warranted endangered rather than threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. Today’s agreement maintains the bird’s threatened status and requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to develop a recovery plan to identify and reduce threats to the species within 30 months. \n \n“Our agreement ensures the Gunnison sage grouse will get a recovery plan before it’s too late to save these magnificent birds,” said Ryan Shannon, a staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This critically imperiled species has really suffered as its habitat has been lost to oil and gas drilling, urban sprawl and overgrazing. A robust recovery plan is a good first step toward preventing the grouse’s extinction.” \n \nThe grouse is limited to a relatively small area of southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah. Because of a history of habitat loss and fragmentation, a mere seven isolated populations remain, with a total population of only approximately 4,000 birds as of spring 2017. Of those seven populations, six are in decline. \n \n“There is no doubt that the Gunnison sage grouse should be listed as endangered,” said Talasi Brooks, a staff attorney at Advocates of the West. “But given the severity of threats the few remaining birds continue to face, our agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provides a viable path to recovery for the species. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the best outcome for Gunnison sage grouse.” \n \n“Gunnison sage grouse continue to be endangered because of loss of habitat,” said Gunnison sage-grouse expert Dr. Clait Braun. “This agreement has reasonable potential to stabilize populations over time through development of a recovery plan.” \n \nThe agreement ensures the recovery plan will be based on the best available science and address the impediments to the grouse’s recovery from livestock grazing and other threats. \n \n“Livestock grazing is a major problem for the Gunnison sage grouse, with two-thirds of public-land grazing leases failing to meet even the most basic land-health standards,” said Erik Molvar of Western Watersheds Project. “Federal and local agencies have turned a blind eye to habitat degradation caused by cattle, but this settlement should require federal agencies to start taking steps to remedy problem livestock grazing in important Gunnison sage-grouse habitats.” \n \n“Past and current conservation efforts have failed this magnificent bird,” said Bethany Cotton, wildlife program director at WildEarth Guardians. “We are hopeful a robust, science-based recovery plan will finally get Gunnison sage grouse on the road to recovery.” \n \nThe public will have an opportunity to weigh in on the draft Recovery Plan when it is released by the Service. \n \nWestern Watersheds Project and the Center for Biological Diversity were represented by Center attorneys; WildEarth Guardians and Dr. Braun were represented by attorneys at Advocates for the West. \n \nBackground \nDespite clear ongoing threats to the bird’s survival, in November 2014 the Service designated Gunnison sage grouse as a threatened species, rather than the more protective endangered species designation the agency had proposed in January 2013. The Service also announced plans to develop a special rule allowing the same destructive activities threatening the bird to continue. However, the special rule never materialized. \n \nIn 2014 the Service also significantly reduced the area to be protected as critical habitat for the dancing birds by nearly 275,000 acres between the proposed and final rules. During the time between the proposed endangered listing in January 2013 and the reduced-protection threatened listing in December 2014, the Gunnison Basin population dropped from 4,082 to 3,978 birds, state and local governments failed to adopt enforceable protections that address the threats facing the bird, and development and grazing continued to degrade the species’ habitat."}

The meeting included various presentations on budgets and risk and ended with the election of four students to the AMS Board of Directors. \n Board of Directors report  \nOn behalf of the various committees under the AMS Board of Directors, Tyler Lively and Aniqah Mair delivered presentations regarding the finances, governance and personnel of the AMS. \n \nAccording to Lively, one of the key issues the Board discussed throughout the year was how the minimum wage increase would affect the AMS. He explained that by the time the minimum wage rises to $15 per hour next year, wages and salaries within the society will see an $800,000 total increase. \n \nGoing forward, Lively said the Board will oversee the implementation of cost control measures to ensure the society remains protected. Part of this involves assessing student services that are underperforming and the specific lines of business within them that are declining. \n \nLively said services like TAPS and The Journal can’t be expected to see a huge increase in revenue due to fundamental limitations to the services. Instead, going forward the Board will have to reassess the way these services operate — one suggestion being a shift away from solely student-run services with the introduction of professional, permanent managers. \n \nAccording to Lively, hiring permanent managers for the services is being proposed “as something the Board should be looking at next year.” The Board agreed this could reduce the risks associated with frequent turnover in high-level positions. \n \nThis suggestion extends beyond the corporate side of the AMS. Lively mentioned the Board is recommending the AMS hire a permanent Human Resources staff member to tackle increased burdens that have been placed on the HR office. A permanent staff member would also allow for students to receive professional development mentoring. \n \nLively specifically mentioned that the Board of Directors will be closely examining TAPS to try and “understand what’s driving the dismal financial performance of the service.” Overall, the Board is focused on critically evaluating jobs and salaries in the AMS to make sure operations remain streamlined and the society remains financially stable. \n Executive presentation  \nAMS Vice-President (Operations) Chelsea Hollidge delivered a presentation regarding the projected year-end financial results of the AMS services. Hollidge identified key variances in the projections and explained them to students. \n \nOn the government side of the AMS, the Campus Activities Commission is projecting a deficit of approximately $45,000 due to the dissolution of four of its committees in February.  \n \n\n \nGraphic by Rebecca Frost \n \nOn the services side, TAPS projected a major deficit of $199,000. Hollidge attributed this in part to a larger societal trend of young people buying less alcohol and to a lack of attendance at The Underground.  \n \nStuCons are expecting a $50,000 surplus mainly due to the new StuCon bursary being underused. This money will return to the AMS consolidated budget, but Vice-President (University Affairs) Palmer Lockridge says he expects the bursary will be used more in the upcoming year. \n \nDespite a projected surplus of $25,000, Tricolour Outlet has seen a decline in their used books and bus services. As a result, they’re projected to finish the year with a deficit of $5,400. These lines of business will be closely evaluated by managerial AMS staff going forward. \n \nThe Journal is expected to run a $57,000 deficit. According to Hollidge, this is mainly due to larger trends in the journalism industry, as papers struggle to move away from print media.  \n Board of Directors elections  \nThe meeting ended with the election of four students to the AMS Board of Directors. \n \nJordan Nensi, Comm ’20, and Leah Bourque, Sci ’20, were elected to serve two-year terms as student directors, while Evan Goldman, Comm ’19, and Julia Kruja, Comm ’19, were elected to serve one-year terms."}
{"articleID":33582617563,"title":"Managing costs with quality is top priority for healthcare providers: Bain & Company","content":"At a time when regulatory uncertainty and pricing pressures are plaguing the healthcare industry, managing costs with quality is at the top of the agenda for Indian healthcare providers, according to a report by Bain & Company, titled ‘Operational Excellence in Healthcare Delivery in India — A Critical Imperative During a Painful Transition’ released on Friday. The report which seeks to understand the existing realities and perspectives of India's healthcare system, is based on the findings of Bain's research conducted among NATHEALTH members across India. It goes on to suggest measures, which if adopted, would improve revenues and reduce costs of private healthcare providers. Designing operations at hospitals by taking into account procurement, monitoring staffing and pricing is therefore taking centre-stage among healthcare providers to manage costs and boost profitability. The research made it abundantly clear that regulation, intense activism, competition and public trust-or lack thereof, constantly tug at private healthcare providers in India. Eighty per cent of respondents said that regulatory uncertainty and pricing pressures were the top sustainability concerns plaguing India's healthcare providers. Consequently, the report noted that several healthcare service providers in India are constrained in terms of their investments in required areas to manage costs. Severity of cases vary, care is not standardized, and the quality of clinical delivery is variable over time and across players. Patient experience and service standards could suffer and deteriorate as providers struggle to manage costs under the evolving market scenario. Parijat Ghosh, Partner, Bain & Company and the lead author of the report said, “Cutting costs to improve profitability has not been easy and failure to take tough and thoughtful decisions on areas of cost cutting adversely impact patient experience.” The report revealed that for both private healthcare providers' viability and patients' health, operational improvements are key. Providers' experience, however, indicates that few have succeeded in making such improvements. Only about 20 per cent of the respondents have benefitted from operational improvement measures. About 65 per cent are still in the process of implementing solutions; most are attempting to optimise only procurement, processes and overhead. Based on patient feedback, some healthcare providers in recent years have focused on quality and therefore opted for accreditations, which lead to higher-quality patient care and safety. This accreditation approach not only benefits patients but also distinguishes hospitals in a competitive environment, the report says. Healthcare providers have reduced costs through three methods which include, front-end manpower cost optimization, material cost optimization, overhead optimization. A good cost transformation strategy focusses on the need, profile and behavioural patterns of customers. This customer-centric approach formulates an integrated roadmap that includes change management as well as zero-based cost accounting. Bain research indicates that behaviour change is often the biggest challenge during and after an operations transformation programme. Any management executive embarking on an operations transformation initiative in a provider setting is advised to focus on change management to realise its value. Using a data-based, objective approach identifies delivery risk areas early and measures and mitigates the risk by allowing early intervention. Anjan Bose, Secretary General, NATHEALTH said, “Enhancing overall operational excellence in structured ways in hospitals can provide a win-win for all: providers, patients and other healthcare stakeholders. The impact will be much more than only regulating the prices of medtech products.”"}

Are providers leveraging the necessary subscriber data to identify potential customers at high risk of churn and are pay TV providers targeting their marketing to this group in effort to combat this action?” said the report. \n \nElsewhere, TiVo found that 68.2% of people now use an SVOD service, up 4.4 percentage points year-on-year, up 12.8 percentage points over two years and up 22.9 points over the past four years. \n \nUnsurprisingly the top three most-used SVOD services were Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, with all three services experiencing gains year-on-year. \n \nYouTube TV also experienced “notable adoption” following its introduction last year and is bow the fourth most popular SVOD service ahead of Sling TV, DirecTV Now and CBS All Access, according to the report. \n \nThe research was based on a survey of 3,330 people in the US and Canada and was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2"}

This guide can be found on the coalition's new website, utilitiesunited.org . \n \nCommon scam tactics \n Service disconnection threats: Customers may receive threats to turn off service - usually in less than an hour - if a large payment is not made.  Immediate payment requests: Customers are asked to quickly purchase a prepaid debit card and provide the card information, which grants the scammer instant access to personal funds. Some scammers may also request a money wire.  Calls that appear to be from your utility: Scammers may rig caller ID to make it look like the call is from a service provider.  \nHow to protect yourself \n We encourage customers who suspect a scam to hang up and call their utility directly, followed by a call to the police. Never dial the phone number the scammers provide.  Do not pay over the phone if immediate payment is demanded to avoid disconnection.  Piedmont never asks or requires a customer with a delinquent account to purchase a prepaid debit card to avoid disconnection. Customers can make payments online or by phone, automatic bank draft or mail.  \nFor more information on how to spot a utility scam and protect personal information, visit utilitiesunited.org . \n \nAbout Piedmont Natural Gas \n \nPiedmont Natural Gas, a North Carolina corporation, is an energy services company whose principal business is the distribution of natural gas to more than a million residential, commercial, industrial and power generation customers in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

It argued Emanuel had cut a secret deal with United Airlines , awarding the hometown carrier with five additional gates at the last moment. Neither Emanuel's office or American responded to requests for comment. United CEO Oscar Munoz held a rally with employees to push for public support of the proposal, while American launched a website making arguments against it. The gates, like all under the city's new lease, would not be operated exclusively by American but are considered advantageous to that carrier because of its current position on the L concourse. City officials plan on borrowing against the negotiated higher fees and airline charges to pay for construction. \n \nAccording to the mayor's proposal, the total number of gates at O'Hare would increase from 185 to 220 by 2026, the amount of space for planes to park at gates would grow by 25 percent and the square feet of terminal space would increase by 72 percent."}

In one of the biggest transactions in domestic aviation space, SpiceJet has inked a USD 12.5 billion deal with French major Safran Group for CFM aircraft engines.\n\nThe deal is for LEAP-1B engines to power a total of 155 Boeing 737 MAX planes, along with spare engines to support the fleet.\n\nDescribing it as a \"landmark deal\" for the airline in terms of purchase of engines and the ten-year maintenance contract, Singh said the engine's fuel burn is around 15 per cent lower, while the contract ensures that there is a one-stop solution.\n\nSpiceJet will pay a flat fee and Safran will look after all the maintenance of engines for the next ten years, he said, adding that there is a great deal of stability in this programme.\n\n\"It will help us reduce our overall cost of operations and therefore it will increase margins for SpiceJet. It will help us be more competitive in the market place,\" Singh, who is the Chairman and Managing Director, told PTI in an interview.\n\nUnder the deal, the no-frills carrier will be getting around 350 engines, including spare ones. It would start getting the engines from August onwards.\n\nReduced fuel burn and operational costs aside, the engines will also help the airline fly the aircraft for extra hours.\n\n\"This engine will enable us to fly one hour extra... Right now, we can do a maximum of four-and-a-half hours. This will add at least one hour and this will mean that several cities that were not within our reach can be within the reach,\" Singh said.\n\nCFM engines are manufactured by CFM International, a joint venture between Safran and General Electric.\n\nSpiceJet's fleet has more than 38 CFM 56-7B-powered Boeing 737 NG family aircraft. The budget carrier operates 408 average daily flights to 52 destinations, including 45 domestic and 7 international ones.\n\nEarlier this month, Safran CEO Philippe Petitcolin had said it expects more big deals like that with SpiceJet and higher share in the Indian commercial aerospace market."}

With approximately 63,000 views for the video, which were amassed in the seven hours since the video was uploaded to YouTube around 3 a.m. ET, on Thursday, March 15, the satirical video is gaining lots of commentary and plenty of ratings on the social media sharing site. \n \nKimmel noted that Melania was coming out of hiding amid the Stormy Daniels melee, as reported by ABC News , to meet with folks representing major social sharing networks like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others to discuss the problem of cyberbullying. Kimmel quipped that if Melania really wanted to address cyberbullying, Mrs. Trump could simply take a sledgehammer to her husband’s thumbs and phone, referencing the controversial Twitter habits of President Donald Trump. \n \nThe video begins with real footage of Melania, but morphs into footage of a woman who sounds a lot like Mrs. Trump speaking in a voiceover as video showing children plays.

Jimmy , according to the Daily Beast, said that Melania’s summit to cease cyberbullying is making “people woozy.” The publication noted that the joke about Camille – wife to an accused serial rapist – drew some groans from the audience. \n \nMelania was in hiding, according to Kimmel, during the time that “Winter Stormy Daniels hit D.C.” The monologue got lots of laughs and attention in the wake of social media users reacting to Melania’s announced summit with the technology officials."}

Northup said that some of the sites were chosen due to already present electrical capabilities. \n \nWhile only seven locations have been approved so far, they are all on track to be fully operational by July. The charging station opened earlier this week at the county’s operations center is the first to be used by the county’s EV fleet. \n \n“Each site was specifically tailored for the fleet vehicle usage at that site,” Northup said. “We’re working directly with those departments to identify the best vehicles for their use.”  \n \nCurrently, there are six Ford C-Max Energi vehicles in use by the General Services fleet that are part of a pilot program testing out a consolidated motor pool and keyless entry system.  \n \nThe county’s goals include a 5% EV vehicle conversion of its light-duty fleet by 2020, for a total of 125 electric vehicles. By May, Northup said the county expects to have 25 fully operational electric and plug-in electric vehicles. It’s estimated that these efforts will decrease a converted vehicle’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. \n \nFor the county, there are added benefits of a decrease in costs for maintenance, operations, and fuel."}

Wearing newly designed front and rear fascias, the Sedona now sports a similar design language utilized on some of the newer models in Kia's lineup, while a new available rear-seat entertainment system along with other convenience features keep the Sedona's tech roster up-to-date. In addition, the Sedona's tried and true 3.3-liter V6 can now be paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. \n\nExperience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: \n\n\"While the Sedona has continued to redefine and revolutionize the minivan segment with its bold design, advanced convenience features and upscale cabin, a subtle facelift and extended tech roster help keep our most functional multi-purpose vehicle fresh and relevant,\" said Orth Hedrick , vice president, product planning, Kia Motors America (KMA).  \"The enhancements that come as part of the new model year are sure to continue raising the Sedona's appeal and desirability.\" \n\nThe Sedona is offered in five trim levels – L, LX, EX, EX Premium, SX, and SXL. Pricing will be announced closer to the vehicle's on-sale date. \n\nBold Exterior Style \nStaying true to the CUV-like proportions that came as a result of Kia's design-led transformation, the Sedona's front fascia is defined by a more modern headlight configuration that helps achieve a sharper appearance, with distinctive LED headlamps that are standard on SX and SXL trims. Sitting proudly in between the headlamps is Kia's signature 'tiger nose' grill highlighted with a detailed mesh-like pattern. Beneath it, a reconfigured bumper and air intake add a dash of sportiness. Around back, the rear combination lamps – complete with a new graphic – flank the restyled chrome garnish on the liftgate. The side profile, defined by its reduced front and rear overhangs and deeply swept windshield, becomes more distinctive thanks to newly designed 17-, 18-, and 19-inch wheels, based on trim. And because busy families appreciate a helping hand, a newly added power sliding door button located on the side door handles of EX trims and above is designed to be just that, providing easier access to the Sedona's well-appointed cabin. Adding more flair to the model line is the SXL trim, which comes equipped with a unique bumper, skid plate, LED headlamps and foglights, 19-inch chrome wheels and distinctive side sill. \n\nA Nicer Place to Be \nThe Sedona's award-winning interior adds more refinement for the new model year. Up front, drivers are treated to a more modern center fascia complete with new graphics in the instrument cluster. The floor console between the front seats now features an available wireless charger 2 and sunglasses holder to help minimize clutter, while an electronic parking brake is standard on SX and SXL trims. Rear passengers are also sure to enjoy a handful of upgrades designed with them in mind. An available USB charge point has been added to the luggage area and is accessible to those riding in the third row, though it may also come in handy during activities such as outdoor family picnics, camping or tailgating 3 . During longer road trips, it's nice to have additional entertainment, especially with little ones in tow. To help keep them occupied, the Sedona's available Rear Entertainment System adds 10.1-inch dual touchscreens located on the back of the front seats, replacing the outgoing model's single overhead screen. Upgraded with a dual core CPU, the system now has smartphone-mirroring functionality and internet access via the user's compatible smartphone 4 , meaning passengers can play their favorite online videos on the screens. Completing the RSE package are two wireless Bluetooth ®5  enabled headphones with enhanced comfort and sound quality. \n\nThe outgoing Sedona's Infinity ®6 sound system has been swapped out for an available Harman Kardon ®7 premium audio system that pumps out music through eight speakers. Other upscale options include available wood grain trim on the front door panels, an LED mood lamp, and the choice between an available single or dual sunroof. The Sedona's CUV-like proportions continue to provide flexible seating in both seven- and available eight-passenger configurations, the Sedona continues to offer the choice of available second row Slide-N-Stow seats or second row \"First Class\" reclining lounge seats[8] with footrests. The multi-purpose vehicle also keeps its available third row which provides the convenience of a split folding 60/40, in-floor-retractable design. \n\nDriver Convenience and Technology \nIn addition to Forward Collision Warning (FCW) 9 , Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go (SCC) 9 , Rear Cross Traffic Collision Warning 9 (RCW), Blind Spot Collision Warning (BCW) 9 , and Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) 9 , Sedona now offers Driver Attention Warning (DAW) 10 . FCA is designed to help detect and alert the driver of a collision risk and automatically apply the brakes in certain situations. DAW is designed to detect when driver concentration has waned by monitoring vehicle and driving behavior. If driver fatigue or inattentive driving is detected, the system issues visual and audible warnings, including a coffee cup icon in the instrument cluster, to encourage the driver to take a break. With the new additions, the Sedona is expected to earn the prestigious Top Safety Pick + rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) when equipped with optional Forward Collision Warning for the 2019 model year.  \n\nUnderneath the Hood \nThe Sedona's tried and true Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) 3.3-liter V6 engine is now paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission that replaces the 6-speed automatic in the outgoing model. While power figures remain unchanged with the engine making 276 horsepower and 248 lb.-ft. of torque, the new transmission is designed to create a more seamless driving experience and help improve combined fuel economy figures 11 .  In addition, the Sedona continues to offer a three-step Variable Induction System (VIS) that improves engine \"breathing\" by automatically adjusting the intake runner lengths to optimize engine torque under different load conditions.  \n\nAbout Kia Motors America \nHeadquartered in Irvine, California , Kia Motors America continues to top quality surveys and is recognized as one of the 100 Best Global Brands and 50 Best Global Green Brands by Interbrand. Kia serves as the \"Official Automotive Partner\" of the NBA and LPGA and offers a complete range of vehicles sold through a network of nearly 800 dealers in the U.S., including cars and SUVs proudly built in West Point, Georgia * \n\nFor media information, including photography, visit .  To receive custom email notifications for press releases the moment they are published, subscribe at . \n\n* The Sorento and Optima GDI (EX, SX & Limited and certain LX Trims only) are assembled in the United States from U.S. and globally sourced parts \n\n1 Actual mileage will vary with options, driving conditions, driving habits and your vehicle's condition. \n2 Charging system only works with select devices.

Brown recently unveiled a new infrastructure proposal that would expand the TIGER Grant Program. Brown has worked to secure TIGER grants for Ohio communities. $9.9 million to fund Ohio’s public transit system, through the Federal Transit Administration’s “State of Good Repair and “Buses and Bus Facilities” formula programs. This money supplements the approximately $187 million of transit funding Ohio will receive this year under the FAST Act. The bill specifically includes $2 million to expand testing of new low-emission and zero-emission buses. The Ohio State University (OSU) and the university-affiliated Transportation Research Center (TRC) are one of just two testing centers in the nation that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) will utilize to undertake the work. Brown – who serves as the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which oversees FTA – worked to secure the funding, and he included language to allow manufacturers of electric, fuel cell and other low-emission vehicles to bring their new models to Ohio for testing. Previously, all testing of new bus models had to be conducted at a single oversubscribed facility in Pennsylvania. Allowing OSU and TRC to conduct testing will speed the delivery of low-emission buses to public transportation agencies working to reduce fuel consumption and improve air quality. Brown was previously instrumental in obtaining a for testing bus components, which qualified their testing center for the latest funding. During Senate consideration of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act in 2015, Brown worked to double federal investment in zero-emission projects in public transit.\n\nMIL OSI USA –"}

Now it’s on the cusp of an even bigger deal: potentially being snapped up by Remgro . A Bloomberg report says that talks are at an advanced stage and that if the deal falls through, Vumatel may even consider listing on the JSE. This is a great development for South Africa amid Telkom continuing to dominate the fixed-line space in South Africa. – Gareth van Zyl \n \n(Bloomberg) – Remgro Ltd. is in advanced talks to buy fibre provider Vumatel Pty Ltd. as South Africa’s richest man seeks to consolidate the country’s expanding broadband infrastructure industry, according to people familiar with the matter. \n   \nA deal by billionaire Johann Rupert ’s investment vehicle would give an equity value of closely-held Vumatel of about 1.1 billion rand ($93 million), said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are private. \nFile Photo: Billionaire Johann Rupert speaks with delegates during the Business of Luxury summit in Monaco.

{"articleID":33514178607,"title":"Top Trend for 2018: Adoption of Intelligent Automation","content":"KPMG reported in a recent survey that the top trend for 2018 is the adoption of intelligent automation (IA) as a business strategy. The survey, which KPMG publishes on a quarterly basis, reviews global business services, IA, and related service delivery market trends. \n \nKPMG found that 62% of respondents believe that IA and digital labor are the trends that will have the largest positive impact on the respondents’ organizations in 2018. One of the business concerns driving the adoption of IA is the challenge that organizations have in finding, training, and keeping talent, which was the largest negative trend that respondents predict when looking ahead to 2019. \n \nAccording to the organizations surveyed, continued efforts to cut costs and investments in new or improved traditional and emerging IT are their key initiatives for 2018. In order to be successful in undertaking these key initiatives, the organizations cite that they will need to engage in smart and innovative management practices and eliminate dysfunctional and fragmented organizational and operating models, designs, and processes. \n \nThe survey concludes with actions that organizations should consider when adopting IA as a solution. Prior to adopting an IA solution, organizations should take a holistic approach to the adoption of IA, which should include the review of operating models, governance, change management, personnel and IA’s interaction with other technologies. After the adoption of an IA solution, the organization should continue to monitor the solution to ensure that unnecessary work is eliminated rather than simply automated and that the solution is continuing to meet business requirements. \n \nThe survey also notes that while the adoption and exploitation of IA is the leading positive trend for 2018, organizations should not neglect other critical requirements to remain competitive, nor should they ignore external forces which may have a large impact on their business, including changes to the regulatory environment or to the economic situation in the market. \n \nRead the 4Q 2017 KPMG Global Insights Pulse Survey Report ."}

{"articleID":33459204252,"title":"Rewards program encourages food stamp recipients to make healthy choices","content":"Cities and states are trying new ways to entice food stamp recipients to eat their fruits and vegetables.\n\nOne approach that’s gaining popularity: offering rebates to low-income families when they buy fresh produce. A program in Massachusetts was so popular that it ran out of rebate money and had to be suspended.\n\nBy rewarding food stamp recipients for making healthy choices, advocates hope to encourage low-income people to eat more fruits and vegetables.\n\nBuying fresh fruits and vegetables can be expensive — especially for families trying to live on $126 a person, the average monthly food stamp benefit in 2017. That’s $1.40 for a meal. But even as food advocates are trying to make these programs work, they worry that efforts underway in Washington could eliminate them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump this month proposed slashing benefits under the federal food stamp program by nearly 30 percent. To help cut costs, food stamp recipients would get a box of canned and packaged goods rather than using their benefits to choose their own food — an idea that food security researchers and advocates say would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nTrump’s proposals “are about saving money for purposes other than public health,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “But surely public health is a public good worth supporting?”\n\nTrump’s budget proposal would also eliminate funding for the Food Insecurity Nutrition Initiative (FINI), a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that gives grants to programs that offer incentives to food stamp recipients for buying produce.\n\nAnd that has advocates worried. While presidential budgets routinely are considered “dead on arrival” in Congress, lawmakers are at work on a new farm bill, which would provide funding for the food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the FINI grants.\n\nThe FINI program was created by the 2014 farm bill, and Congress appropriated $100 million for the program, to be doled out over a four-year period, through 2018. Programs that get FINI grants all offer incentives to low-income shoppers, such as coupons or loyalty cards. Typically, for every dollar spent on produce, shoppers get another dollar to buy more later.\n\nThe program operates in 39 states, but data on how many programs are running nationwide or how many food stamp recipients it serves is not available, said Selina Meiners, a USDA spokeswoman.\n\nFINI grants to cities and states range from $100,000 for small-scale pilot projects to several million dollars for large-scale projects. Sometimes the money goes to nonprofits and farmers markets that work with state agencies that administer the food stamp program; sometimes it goes directly to state-run initiatives. And sometimes local governments and nonprofits match the federal funding.\n\nThe chairman of the U.S. Senate agriculture committee, Republican Pat Roberts of Kansas, is working on the new farm bill, but declined to comment on whether he supports the president’s proposed cuts. U.S. Rep. Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, also declined to comment.\n\nEliminating federal funding for the food program “would have huge consequences,” said Julia Koprak, a senior associate at the Food Trust, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit funded in part by a FINI grant.\n\n“More people will go hungry,” Koprak said.\n\nEarly evaluations of FINI projects show benefits. An April 2017 report by the Farmers Market Coalition, a Pennsylvania-based advocacy group, found that in 2016, around the country, households on food stamps that were enrolled in the program consumed . The report found the program generated an estimated $14.3 million in economic activity for participating communities.\n\nBut food advocates worry that might not be enough to sway Congress.\n\n“It’s hard to prove that eating more healthfully produces immediate — measurable — results,” said NYU’s Nestle, the author of “Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health.”\n\n“If budget cutters insist on definitive proof,” she said, “it’s not possible to give it to them.”\n\nFarmers Market Coupons\n\nFINI got its start in 2014, but the idea of helping low-income Americans spend more of their food dollars on fresh fruit and vegetables has been bouncing around for a while.\n\nAbout a dozen years ago, a handful of farmers markets in Harlem, the South Bronx, and Takoma Park, Maryland, began offering coupons to food stamp recipients so they could buy more produce.\n\nAnd in 2008, the farm bill provided $20 million for pilot programs around the country that encourage low-income families to eat more fruits and vegetables.\n\nMassachusetts and Michigan were among the first states to try out that hypothesis on a formal basis, and the success of those pilots prompted Congress to create FINI in 2014.\n\nIn 2009, Detroit started offering food stamp recipients “Double Up Food Bucks” to buy fresh fruit and vegetables at five area farmers markets. The program has now grown to 150 sites across Michigan and has served over 300,000 families.\n\nThe Michigan program was able to expand when the USDA in 2015 awarded its administrator, the nonprofit Fair Food Network, a $5 million FINI grant, which was then matched by a private funder.\n\nA Massachusetts program in 2011 started giving food stamp recipients 30 cents for every dollar they spent buying produce from local farmers.\n\nThe program proved to be successful: Participants spent more on fresh produce — and ate more fruits and vegetables.\n\nSo last year, with a three-year, $3.4 million FINI grant, Massachusetts expanded the program. Some 35,000 households across the state snapped up nearly all of the matching funds within the year.\n\nBecause officials had run through most of the money two years ahead of schedule, the state will temporarily suspend the program from mid-April to July, according to the state’s Department of Transitional Assistance.\n\nWhile the program is suspended, food stamp recipients can still use their benefits to buy produce at farm stands — just without the rebate.\n\nMás Fresco\n\nIn 2016, University of California at San Diego received a $3.4 million FINI grant to launch a similar program in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, called Más Fresco/More Fresh.\n\nLocal community health workers, “promotoras,” armed with computer tablets, go to participating grocery stores to recruit food stamp recipients in predominantly Latino communities.\n\nOnce they’ve signed up, the recipients use loyalty reward cards to access rebates that double the value of the money they spend on produce. Some people are randomly selected to receive even more benefits, up to $40 a month.\n\nLast year, 1,153 food stamp recipients signed up for the program. This year, the goal is to sign up another 2,000, said Joe Prickitt, senior director of the Southern California Nutrition Incentive Program at UC San Diego Center for Community Health, which runs the program.\n\nThe program helps those who get food stamps while spurring on the local economy, providing jobs to retailers, food growers and food distributors, Prickitt said. “This is much, much bigger than just providing money to SNAP recipients.”\n\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy."}

The compromised email account was used to send spam messages to an email list of individuals not associated with CareFirst. However, because the email account was compromised, the attackers gained access to the employee's email and could have potentially accessed personal information of 6,800 CareFirst members, including names, member identification numbers, date of birth, and in limited cases (8 individuals) social security numbers. No medical or financial information was compromised.\n\nThe original phishing message and the resulting spam messages have been forensically examined by CareFirst's information security team as well as by a 3rd party information security firm. CareFirst's systems in general were also forensically analyzed. There was no evidence of malware in the phishing email or spam and no other suspicious activity was detected within CareFirst's systems.

{"articleID":33577944958,"title":"Toy Makers Rattled by Loss of Toys 'R' Us -- ...","content":"Best Buy (NYSE:BBY)\n\nIntraday Stock Chart \n\nHeute : Freitag 16 März 2018\n\nBy Paul Ziobro and Lillian Rizzo This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 16, 2018). \n\nThe liquidation of Toys \"R\" Us Inc. has sent the toy industry reeling, leaving Mattel Inc., Hasbro Inc. and other manufacturers without a large chain devoted to selling games and dolls and forcing them to scramble to secure other outlets to carry their items. \n\nToys \"R\" Us, which had more than $11 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, is one of the retail chains that were once seen by vendors as \"category killers\" and have emerged as crucial checks on the power of Amazon.com Inc. Stores like Best Buy Co. and Barnes & Noble Co. provide electronics manufacturers and book publishers with vast networks of physical showrooms. \n\nThe likely death of Toys \"R\" Us, which early Thursday filed plans to liquidate its U.S. operations and other businesses, means the $27 billion U.S. toy industry will no longer have a national partner to showcase its wares year-round, test experimental products and find the next Shopkins or ZhuZhu Pet. \n\nIt was a quick unraveling for Toys \"R\" Us since its September chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. In a call with employees Wednesday, Toys \"R\" Us Chief Executive David Brandon described a cascading series of events, starting with what he described as a \"devastating\" holiday season that led to plans to close more stores and then to exit from the baby-products business to focus on toys. \n\n\"The hole that we dug in the holiday season put us in a position where our lender became justifiably nervous as the company was continuing to consume cash,\" Mr. Brandon said. \n\nUltimately, the company is expected to liquidate its entire U.S. operation, a decision that would affect 33,000 jobs. The company also is liquidating operations in other countries, and plans to sell its business in Canada, Central Europe and Asia. \n\nNow, 70 years after Charles Lazarus opened what would become America's main toy destination, its stores may disappear from U.S. soil. \n\n\"This industry has been devastated,\" said Tom Murdough, founder of Simplay3 Co., which makes plastic play sets and ridable vehicles. \"This is a major, major hit to the industry.\" \n\nIn five decades of selling toys, Mr. Murdough hasn't known a day without Toys \"R\" Us. He founded and sold both Little Tikes Co. and Step2 Co. in the past and he now is the CEO of Simplay3, which he said gets between 20% and 30% of its sales through Toys \"R\" Us. Toy makers don't anticipate recouping all of their sales this year, or ever, if Toys \"R\" Us goes away permanently without a replacement. UBS estimates that Hasbro would lose close to 3% of its sales for the year if Toys \"R\" Us liquidates, while Mattel stands to lose slightly more. \n\nHasbro CEO Brian Goldner said the maker of Nerf blasters and My Little Pony dolls is looking for new places to take its inventory. But that is more challenging earlier in the year compared with the end, when retailers are trying to fill shelves with holiday toys. \n\n\"There will be some disruption, more short term than long term, and then we move forward with growth,\" Mr. Goldner said at an investor conference this month. \n\nThe toy-industry growth rate could slump going forward, too. Toys \"R\" Us was primarily responsible for uncovering what would become the next big thing, since it took chances that other retailers avoided. \"There aren't going to be as many breakout hits, not as many new items that can blossom,\" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson. \"Toys 'R' Us was a testing ground for a lot of things.\" \n\nToy maker shares, including those of Mattel, Hasbro, Spin Master Corp. and Jakks Pacific Inc. were trading down slightly at midday Thursday. \n\nToy sales may be concentrated in the other two large retailers, Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., in the near term. Those mass retailers primarily sell the top-selling items instead of taking risks, Mr. Johnson said. That means market shares could also build among the larger toy companies, too. \"Small companies won't have an opportunity to shine,\" he said. \n\nSome toy companies have expanded their presence in unexpected places in recent years, so the blow isn't as bad as it might have been when Toys \"R\" Us held a larger share of the market. Jeremy Padawer, co-president of Wicked Cool Toys, the maker of Cabbage Patch dolls and Pokémon toys, says that not only has Amazon.com become a bigger part of its business, but sites like Zulily.com, retailers like Hallmark and even grocers and drugstores have become options to sell its toys. \n\nMr. Padawer said Wicked Cool is redoubling efforts to find new retail outlets, even though he doesn't expect to be able to replace all of its Toys \"R\" Us sales, which he estimates at 15% of the business, over the next year. \n\n\"While painful, we recognize there is an immediate opportunity to replace some of the business,\" Mr. Padawer said. \"It will be a mutual dance between buyers seeking market share and opportunistic merchants.\" \n\nCorrections & Amplifications Tom Murdough previously founded and sold a company called Little Tikes Co.

But that doesn't mean he wants to. \n\nAt first glance, it's a sincere reaction to the Cambridge Analytica scandal . Under the rubric \"It's Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find\" , Facebook Inc. outlined how it will show users what personal data the social network holds, who can see it, and -- crucially -- limit how it can be used to serve you ads. You'll also be able to delete any of it from its servers. \n\nYet tagged onto the end of the first paragraph is a seemingly casual aside: \"Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\" \n\nThe reality is that most, if not all, of the measures are required by the General Data Protection Regulation , a law imposed by the European Union which becomes enforceable from May 25 th . The ability to download your photos and posts and move them elsewhere? That falls under the GDPR's \"Data Portability\" stipulations. To delete data? The GDPR dubs that the \"Right to be Forgotten\". Seeing how your data is used to push ads in your direction? That's the \"Right to Access\". \n\nAccelerating the measures is clearly politically expedient, which is why I chuckled at the assertion in the press release headline that \"It's Time\". As with so much news-flow relating to data over the past two years, there's an overwhelming sense that the barn door is casually being closed long after the horse has bolted .  \n\nAdmittedly, Facebook would only have been forced to implement the new GDPR measures in Europe. But it would have been a pain anyway to manage two different data policies around the world. \n\nThere's little doubt that the measures imposed by GDPR will hurt Zuckerberg's company. Having so many of your photos stored on the social network, for instance, discourages you from quitting. It builds \"stickiness\", as the industry calls it. Now you can download and delete all those snaps, it's easier to kick your Facebook habit. That could prove significant: Its daily active users had already  declined in the U.S. in the fourth quarter for the first time. \n\nThe penalty, should Facebook infringe any of these European rules, is relatively steep: 4 percent of global revenue.

Walmart International Toys R Us Educational toys Toy shop | Bankrupt Toys ‘R’ Us Inc is preparing to sell or close all 885 stores in its U.S. chain, risking up to 33,000 jobs, after failing to reach a deal to restructure billions of dollars in debt, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\n\nWith shoppers flocking to online platforms like Amazon.com Inc and children choosing electronic gadgets over toys, Toys ‘R’ Us has struggled to service debt from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms KKR & Co LP and Bain Capital and real estate investor Vornado Realty Trust in 2005.\n\nToys ‘R’ Us had been closing one-fifth of its US stores as part of efforts to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer.\n\nBut creditors decided they can get more from liquidating assets of the toy seller, the largest in the United States and one of the best known in the world, rather than finding a way to keep the business alive, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private negotiations.\n\nA Toys ‘R’ Us spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe company is expected to make a filing with the bankruptcy court late on Wednesday, the person said.\n\nThe planned closure in coming months is a blow to generations of consumers and hundreds of toy makers that sold products at the chain, including Barbie maker Mattel Inc, board game company Hasbro Inc and other large vendors such as Lego.\n\nIn Britain, the remaining 75 Toys ‘R’ Us shops will close within six weeks, joint administrators for the retailer said earlier on Wednesday, after they were unable to find a buyer for all or part of the business, resulting in the loss of about 3,000 jobs.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday reported that Toys ‘R’ Us Chief Executive David Brandon told US staff about the likely closures on a conference call.\n\nEfforts to restructure collapsed this month after lenders decided, absent a clear reorganisation plan, they could recover more by closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales, sources with knowledge of the matter said.\n\n“It’s a relentlessly difficult retail environment for mall-based retailers. There just aren’t the same feet coming through the doors,” said Brian Davidoff, a financial restructuring lawyer.\n\nMore than 8,000 US retail stores closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centres.\n\nToys ‘R’ Us is also likely to liquidate in France, Spain, Poland and Australia, Brandon said, according to The Wall Street Journal. It quoted Brandon as adding that the retailer also planned to sell operations in Canada, Central Europe and Asia.\n\nToys ‘R’ Us was already working with liquidators Tiger Capital Group LLC, Great American Group LLC, Hilco Merchant Resources LLC and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC on previously announced store closures, and the four are expected to continue with the additional closings, sources said.\n\nThe future of the retailer’s big-box shops, many located in strip centres, was uncertain.\n\nThe disappearance of Toys ‘R’ Us in the United States and the UK leaves a void for hundreds of toy makers that relied on the chain as a top customer alongside WalMart Inc and Target Corp.\n\nShares in Mattel, the world’s largest toymaker, and No. 2 US toymaker Hasbro tumbled last week on liquidation reports. Both companies rely on Toys ‘R’ Us for roughly 10 percent of their revenues, according to their 2016 annual reports.\n\nThe liquidation will be more painful for small, independent toy makers that relied on the chain as a major showcase, said Lutz Muller, president of consultancy Klosters Trading Corp.\n\n“A large number will go to the wall,” Muller said."}

{"articleID":33549287075,"title":"Elon Musk at SXSW: He’s Not Steve Jobs - in Some Ways, He’s Better","content":"AUSTIN – SXSW surprised everyone on Sunday with a presentation by Elon Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, among other jobs. Formatted as a fireside chat with Westworld co-creator Jonathan Nolan, questions from the audience drove the conversation in a few different directions. \n \nJonathan Nolan, Elon Musk, and Kimball Musk at SxSW, 2018 \n  \nThe presence of Elon Musk wasn’t the only surprise, especially for me as a long-time Apple watcher. I’d never seen Musk speak in public, though of course I’ve watched some of his product announcements online along with the rest of the world. From those, I had always viewed Elon Musk through the same lens as I viewed Steve Jobs: affable founder, achieved significant success, knew how to talk to people, and understood the technology but didn’t actually do the engineering. \n       \nClearly I was wrong. \n Elon Musk on Mars  \nWhen asked about something he wished he could do differently, he relayed the story of starting SpaceX and needing a Chief Engineer. They didn’t have the money to hire a good chief engineer, and saw no point in hiring a bad one…so Elon Musk named himself the chief engineer and started work on the project. To this day he says, “At SpaceX all my time is spent on engineering and design. 80-90%”. Someone else manages the business and operations. According to Musk, “If you don’t understand something at a detailed level you can’t make good decisions.” \n \nSimilarly surprising for me was his candor and confidence when asked by an audience member, “with regards to the Mars mission, how can we help?” Musk seemed almost surprised by the question, saying, “We’re building the BFR right now to get us to Mars. What we need? Good will. Support.” \n \nMusk wasn’t out there asking for money or help. In fact, it was quite obvious that things are very much on schedule, though he did acknowledge, “sometimes my timelines are optimistic,” and he pledged that he was trying to be better about that. Still, on the heels of that admission he said that short up-and-down flights will happen “in the second half of next year.” \n \na circuit board headed to Mars, “Made on Earth by Humans” \n  \nOne interesting part about Mars is that Musk sees well past the “success” of actually getting there. Once we’re able to get there reliably and regularly, in his mind, that’s when the entrepreneurial opportunities related to colonization really begin, though admittedly dangerous, both financially and physically. If you’re one of the first to go, “there’s a good chance you will die,” Musk says half-jokingly, “but plenty of excitement for those who survive.” \n \nHearing Musk discuss it, his Mars focus with SpaceX comes cross in a very philanthropic way. And, to him, it all started with visiting NASA’s website and wondering why there was nothing there about a trip to Mars. \n Elon Musk on AI and STARLINK  \nMusk’s concerns about artificial intelligence were also a surprise. It’s rare to hear a business mogul look for more governmental involvement and restriction, and yet Musk says, “Mark my words: AI is far more dangerous than nukes. So why do we have no regulatory oversight? It’s insane.” \n \nElon Musk isn’t immune to his own Reality Distortion Field, though. When talking about STARLINK, he quickly jokes, “It’s Skynet,” referring to the famed (and currently fictitious!) AI from Terminator that took over the world. He’s bullish on STARLINK’s future, “It’s an internet in the sky. Low latency, high bandwidth internet connectivity throughout the world.” But he says that they’re not putting enough smarts in STARLINK for it to “think” autonomously. \n \nDoesn’t that just mean it’s susceptible to any intelligence – natural or otherwise – that gains access to STARLINK’s controls? \n \nTime will tell!"}

This order follows a previous order for 42 such planes placed several years ago. \n\nAirlines have ordered more than 2,000 GEnx engines since 2004, when Boeing selected the model for its 787 Dreamliner jets. Eager to save weight and improve efficiency, GE engineers took the GE90, the world's most powerful jet engine developed a decade earlier, and remodeled it. \n\nThey developed two versions of the engine: the larger GEnx-1B for the Dreamliner and the slightly smaller GEnx-2B engine, which powers the 747-8. They include massive, sinuous fan blades made from and other advanced technologies. Above. A GEnx engine during assembly at GE Aviation's facility in Peebles, Ohio. Top: A GEnx engine on a .

The GEnx engines are the most reliable engine available on the Dreamliner with the lowest fuel burn and longest range, according to GE They also are startlingly quiet compared with their peers. Shortly after they entered service, concerned California residents reportedly called the San Bernardino Port Authority to complain that Boeing was flying a new 747-8 freighter over their homes with the engines off. They could be forgiven - pilots too have been known to glance at their fuel gauges to make sure the engines are still running. \n\nThe GEnx has already entered the record books. In 2011, a GEnx-1B-powered Dreamliner on a tank of gas, then finished the job on the next tank. The journey set a weight-class distance record for the 10,337-nautical mile first leg and a record for quickest around-the-world flight at an astonishing 42 hours and 27 minutes. \n\nWhat's next? GE engineers could upgrade the engines with space-age materials called , or CMCs. CMCs can handle temperatures as high as 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit and withstand the punishing forces inside the engines. They are also a third lighter than the conventional alloys now used to make jet engine parts. Future models also could include fuel nozzles already working inside the LEAP and , plus other components.

{"articleID":33624183187,"title":"Eye on E-Commerce Fraud: CyberSource And Worldpay Harness Machine Learning And Big Data","content":"Machine learning and huge swaths of data are being enlisted in the battle to counter online fraud, with CyberSource announcing an enhancement to its fraud-prevention service and processor Worldpay Inc. launching a new fraud-prevention service Wednesday at MRC 2018, the annual conference held by the Merchant Risk Council. \n \nCyberSource, a unit of Visa Inc. since 2010, announced machine learning is coming to its rule-creation service. Dubbed the Rules Suggestion Engine, the service uses a merchant’s unique transaction data to generate recommended rules for e-commerce transactions. The goal is to authorize as many legitimate transactions as possible and do so in an automated fashion. \n         Mattei: “What we’re hearing from our merchants is that there is value in the card-present data.” \nThe service works by analyzing the broader base of transaction data that runs through CyberSource and present new transaction rules that might catch fraudulent transactions. \n \n“The big advantage is, it’s made for merchants that have an educated risk analyst,” Scott Boding, CyberSource vice president of product management, tells Digital Transactions News . “It’s not just about preventing chargebacks. It’s about looking at the overall process and making sure good customers get through.” \n \nThe Rules Suggestion Engine is available now in conjunction with Decision Manager Replay , a service CyberSource introduced in 2015 that enables e-commerce merchants to test various anti-fraud measures for online transactions. \n \nWorldpay , the name of the newly combined Vantiv Inc. and Worldpay Group plc, said it is working with Featurespace Ltd., a United Kingdom-based behavioral-analytics technology company, on a new fraud-prevention service that uses machine learning to thwart criminals. \n \n“Data is king,” David Mattei, Worldpay vice president and fraud-product manager, tells Digital Transactions News . Available in the second half of the year, the service will tap into the combined 40 billion transactions processed by Worldpay around the globe to better distinguish legitimate consumers from those with ill intent. \n \nUnlike some other services, the Worldpay service will include card-present as well as card-not-present data, Mattei says. “What we’re hearing from our merchants is that there is value in the card-present data,” Mattei says. ‘There’s a lot of detail in the card-present transaction.” \n \nIt can help a merchant risk manager if he knows which card a consumer used in a store and if the same card appears on the merchant’s e-commerce site. Or, it may aid the validity check of a consumer who used one card in a store, and chose to use a different card online, Mattei says. The service can help merchants identify that the transaction is coming from the same individual and avoid viewing the consumer as one not seen before. \n \nWorldpay is able to do this from information culled at the card-authorization step, Mattei says. It takes that information and adds data from the Worldpay transaction file that can be associated with the card. Then, the data is passed to the Worldpay fraud system, which is where Featurespace’s analytical prowess, and that of others, is applied. “Rather than just the authorization, we’re adding a lot more value with the fraud system and then using it for the decisioning process,” Mattei says. \n \nThe new service will be available to merchants of all sizes internationally and through multiple sales channels, he says. Pricing is still in development. A self-managed option is available, as is a managed service, which Mattei predicts will be predominant, that will see Worldpay professionals acting on behalf of merchants. \n \nCoincidentally, Worldpay and Vantiv, prior to the merger and independent of each other, had selected Featurespace for a role in what would have been their own services."}

This data is gathered and analysed to determine key trends in DDoS (Distributed denial-of-service) attack activity and results in several interesting insights. \n \n“DDoS attacks are measured in different ways,” says Bryan Hamman, Arbor Network’s territory manager for Sub-Saharan Africa. “Volumetric attacks (75.7 percent of all attacks over the period) are often the most destructive as they send a high amount of traffic, or request packets, to a targeted network in an effort to overwhelm its bandwidth capabilities. \n \n“These attacks work to flood the target in the hopes of slowing or stopping their services and, while typically request sizes are in the 100s of Gbps, recent attacks have scaled to over 1Tbps.” This year’s report revealed a decline in peak DDoS size however, from 800Gbps in 2016 to 600Gbps in 2017, but that doesn’t mean attackers weren’t busy, adds Hamman. \n \nAlthough the number of attacks over 100 Gbps in 2017 is down from last year, the overall mix of attack sizes is still shifting up. This year, the percentage of attacks over 1Gbps has increased to 22 percent, growing three years in a row, although the vast majority of attacks, 87 percent, are still smaller than 2Gbps. \n \n“Furthermore, peak attack size might have decreased but ATLAS observed an increase in the number of attacks, reporting 7.5 million attacks in 2017 as opposed to the 6.8 million in 2016.” \n \nArbor believes this is an indication of attacker innovation as they develop new attack vectors and use new tools, like the Mirai botnet’s ability to launch application-layer as well as volumetric attacks. \n \nHamman says that this year, it was decided to extend analysis to include different geographical regions, including South Africa. \n \n“Looking at the top 10 countries attacked in 2017, it was interesting to note that the first four spots are exactly the same as last year, with similar percentages – these being United States (24 percent), South Korea (10.3 percent), China (8.7 percent) and France (4.6 percent). South Africa features in the top 10 targeted countries in eighth position with 2.7 percent of all reported attacks being targeted here,” he explains. \n \n“For attacks greater than 10Gbps by percentage, South Africa was positioned third for having been hit by 8.8 percent of all attacks in this size range following Hong Kong (10.2 percent) and the US (32.5 percent).” \n \nThese statistics are a stark and repeated warning to South African businesses, Hamman states. \n \n“Complexity was a big focus for attackers this year, as opposed to mass attack volumes, with IoT devices being weaponised. This change in approach has been effective too,” he continues. “Enterprises experiencing revenue loss due to DDoS almost doubled this year, bringing the significance of the DDoS threat into sharp relief and highlighting the very real need for an integrated multi-layer defence from the data centre to the cloud.”"}

Since 2004, they have already sold 95 units. \n \n“Alaska Motor Yachts offer a mix of tradition and technology. It’s absolutely boutique, high-grade quality with good range and all the inclusions people are looking for in a long-range cruiser – all this for under $1 million, because we cut out the middle men,” Leigh-Smith said. \n \nMaking its Australian debut at SCIBS is the Beneteau Swift Trawler brand, with the 35 and 44 models presented by Flagstaff Marine. \n \nThe previous 34 model was sold more than 400 since 2003, and the new 35 – launched at the 2017 Southampton Boat Show and boasts large windows and an offset saloon – will replace it. \n \nThe Swift Trawler 44 is a larger version of the 35 – both offer full helms top and bottom and come with bow and stern thrusters. \n \nWith all-new generation features and styling, Integrity Motor Yachts will have four models on display at SCIBS including the 320 Express, 340 Sedan, 380 Sedan and 440 Sedan. \n \n\n \n(Hudson Bay 540) \n \nClipper Motor Yachts will have 10 vessels on-water and is proud to host the world debut of the Hudson Bay 540 and Hudson Bay 390. \n \nwww.sanctuarycoveboatshow.com.au"}

(\"Genetec\"), a leading technology provider of unified security, public safety, operations, and business intelligence solutions, today announced that its next-generation traffic operations platform, Genetec Traffic Sense™, is now available. Genetec Traffic Sense introduces a new, modern, and highly efficient way to manage traffic operations. It delivers a unified view of real-time conditions and vehicle flow to cities, bridge and tunnel operators, state transportation departments, and border crossing agencies, so they can identify and respond to incidents more efficiently, with a complete view of the traffic situation.\n\nReal-time notifications, automated workflows, and guided responses enable traffic management operators to make timely decisions, resulting in drivers getting to their destinations faster. Displaying data on a single interface cuts through the noise and lets operators focus on the tasks that matter - whether that is dynamically updating electronic road signs, or dispatching Emergency Response Units. With Traffic Sense working silently in the background to guide traffic operations teams, drivers experience smoother, quicker journeys - no matter how fast technologies and environments evolve.\n\n\"The growing adoption of new traffic technologies, ride sharing, connected vehicles, and, eventually, self-driving cars, means keeping pace with infrastructure developments is harder than ever. Traffic Sense gives traffic management operators the ability to adapt to these changes. It improves their incident response times, while providing drivers with vital journey information to reduce their travel time and decrease congestion,\" said Christian Chénard-Lemire, Team Lead for Intelligent Mobility at Genetec. \n\nTraffic Sense unifies traffic data, dynamic message sign control, video monitoring, video analytics, and incident management. By tapping into a variety of data sources from roadside sensors to third-party probe data for travel-time analytics, Traffic Sense automatically identifies congestion and abnormal traffic conditions. It correlates traffic data with associated video feeds, all displayed within dynamic maps of roadways, giving operators instant and complete awareness of what is happening. \n\nArmed with this information, traffic operators can quickly bring things back to normal following an incident. Traffic Sense enables organizations to define response plans to guide their operators and ensure that teams respond to incidents in a consistent, efficient and less stressful way. By presenting standard operating procedures on-screen, Traffic Sense guides operators through every step of the process, from identification to resolution. With Traffic Sense, operators can also update signs along affected roadways directly within the software platform, ensuring drivers are well informed at all times. \n\nWhile traditional advanced traffic management systems require extensive custom development, and are slow to adapt to changing environments, Traffic Sense is an open platform designed to quickly and seamlessly integrate new and emerging technologies. This reduces customers' total cost of ownership and shortens implementation cycles significantly.\n\nTraffic Sense is available immediately from select Genetec certified systems integrators in .

Bankier states, \"we believe that authors should be able to get credit for their readership, regardless of whether an article is downloaded from bepress's Digital Commons or SSRN.\" As Watson puts it, the integration will lead to a \"more accurate assessment of the true impact of their legal scholarship\" by harnessing the discovery power that is at the heart of both platforms. SSRN and bepress are leading names in the law scholarship, with thousands of authors and readers who interact with both platforms; as such, the pilot has the potential to have a significant impact in the law sector. \n \nFinally, the pilot explores ways to make life easier for libraries and staff who use both systems. SSRN and bepress will work with library staff at both campuses to obtain faculty permission and experiment with various submission models, including single submission, toward the goal of discovering solutions that help researchers and institutions simplify their processes. \n \nGregg Gordon, the Managing Director for SSRN, notes, \"we look forward to the results of this work; if our community finds this kind of integration with institutional repositories valuable, and if the pilot is replicable at scale, we will explore expanding pilots with other institutional repository platforms beyond Digital Commons.\" \n \nThe pilot is slated to run from March to June of 2018; bepress and SSRN plan to share their findings at the American Association of Law Libraries in July as well as in other public forums following the conference.

{"articleID":33445663918,"title":"Bobcat Builds on 60 Years of Continuing Success","content":"This year Bobcat celebrates the 60th Anniversary of both the company and the Bobcat skid-steer loader. Sixty years ago, Melroe Manufacturing Company, the forerunner to Bobcat Company, introduced a compact front-end loader that evolved quickly into the M-400, the world’s first true skid-steer loader. The M-400 later adopted what became the world famous ‘Bobcat’ brand and its success created the global compact equipment industry we know today. \n \nOver the last sixty years, Bobcat has gone through many changes, but one thing has not changed: Bobcat’s commitment to outstanding quality, workmanship and innovation that has helped to maintain its market leadership, so that one in every two skid-steer loaders sold is still a Bobcat machine. Bobcat products have changed the way the world works and today the Bobcat brand and influence is as strong as ever. \n \nIn 2018, the range of compact loaders including skid-steer, compact track and all-wheel steer models that Bobcat has developed over the last six decades, continues to dominate the market, combined with a host of attachments to meet every specific customer’s needs. Bobcat has also diversified its portfolio with a full line-up of compact excavators and telehandlers that match the same tough internal requirements on reliability and productivity that Bobcat applies to the company’s loaders. \n \nBobcat in EMEA \n \nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), the company’s passion and customer commitment has been invigorated by the development of a fully integrated structure based in the region, capable of defining, designing and manufacturing machines, products and services to meet the specific needs of local markets in EMEA. \n \nIn 2007, this culminated in the opening of the first new Bobcat manufacturing plant outside the US at the heart of the EMEA region at Dobříš, south of Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. Together with the existing telehandler plant at Pontchâteau in the Loire-Atlantique region in North-West France, the Dobříš facilities form part of a prominent manufacturing footprint in EMEA for Bobcat, which the company has used to produce over 80% of the products it markets and sells in the region. \n \nShortly after the Dobříš plant opened, Doosan Infracore purchased the Bobcat machinery business from US industrial conglomerate, Ingersoll Rand. Under Doosan, Bobcat has continued to invest in and increase its operations in the EMEA market. \nIn 2008, the first Bobcat office in the Middle East opened in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and in 2015, Bobcat opened a new Dubai-based Parts Distribution Centre to support the company’s products in the Middle East and Africa. The same year the company also opened the Innovation Center at Dobříš. This is a European Engineering Centre of Excellence, serving as an expert R&D centre for all Bobcat engineering teams across EMEA, with specific responsibility for small loaders and compact excavators from 1-3 tonne. \n \nThe Doosan Bobcat Campus at Dobříš is now unique among the company’s many facilities around the world, combining the manufacturing plant, the Innovation Center, a training centre and a distribution centre at the same location, and is the development point of new products and technology, their production and the delivery of training for dealers and customers in EMEA. \n \nIn 2016, further expanding its operations in EMEA, Bobcat launched a new range of backhoe loaders for sale in markets in the Middle East and Africa. In 2017, the company also launched a backhoe loader range for markets in Russia and CIS. \n \nIncreased Focus on Compact Excavators and Telehandlers \n \nBuilt around the success of the Bobcat skid-steer loader, the diversification of the Bobcat product range has happened progressively. In the last twenty years, in particular, the company’s operations in EMEA have played a key role in the transformation of Bobcat from a producer of skid-steer loaders only into the world’s leading compact equipment manufacturer. \n \nThe contribution from Europe has continued to gather pace. The opening of the Innovation Center in 2015 and expansion of R&D at the Pontchâteau plant have provided new cutting edge engineering and technology for the compact excavator and telehandler lines, respectively. \n \nLast year, Bobcat marked 30 years of success in the compact excavator market and the latest product developments using technology derived from the Innovation Center - the ground-breaking new 2-4 tonne compact excavators – will be shown for the first time at the Intermat Show in April 2018. \n \nThe Bobcat telehandler plant at Pontchâteau celebrates its 55th anniversary in 2018, as the company increases its focus on the telehandler lines with new ranges for both construction and agriculture. To demonstrate its confidence in product quality and performance, Bobcat is now offering a three year warranty on all of its telehandler models."}

We also reduced our headcount by 12 per cent.” \n   \nHe added that the business has in the past two months completed a “small” voluntary early retirement (VER), but did not disclose how many employees were affected or the cost of the layoffs. \n   \nBanks have sent home hundreds of staff following the interest rate capping law. \n   \nThe Barclays redundancy payoff resulted in a four per cent increase in staff costs to Sh10.11 billion last year. \n   \nBarclays, the first Kenyan bank to announce its full-year results, saw its interest income, including loans to customers and government securities, dip 3.4 per cent to Sh27.2 billion. \n   \nNon-interest income, which comprises fees and commissions, dividend income and foreign exchange income, also dropped Sh892 million to close the financial year at Sh8.5 billion. \n   \nThe tier one lender closed the year with a loan book of Sh168.4 billion (similar to the previous year) while customer deposits increased 4.4 per cent to Sh186 billion. \n   \nThe extended electioneering period last year saw some of the bank’s key corporate clients hold back on drawing down on approved facilities due to political jitters. \n   \n“We are seeing these customers come back to draw down on their facilities.

{"articleID":33686116498,"title":"SpaceX will try again to catch a Falcon 9 nos...","content":"SpaceX is flanking the weekend with two launches from opposite coasts — the first of which is taking place this morning from California. A used Falcon 9 rocket is set to launch 10 Iridium telecommunications satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. And then SpaceX will do it all over again with a Falcon 9 launch from Florida on Monday, sending supplies to the International Space Station. \n \nThe company won’t be recovering its rocket today, but it will try to capture part of the vehicle’s nose cone — the bulbous payload fairing that surrounds the satellites during launch. SpaceX owns a boat named Mr. Steven (really) that’s equipped with a giant net to catch the fairing when it falls back to Earth. Once the rocket reaches space, the fairing breaks into two pieces, each of which deploys a parachute-like material known as a parafoil to slow down. Mr. Steven will then try to grab one half of the fairing before it hits the ocean. (Presumably, SpaceX will get another boat once it masters the process.) \n \nThis will be the second attempt by SpaceX to snag part of the payload fairing. The company tried the trick for the first time in February , but the nose cone piece just missed the boat by a few hundred yards. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk argued the problem could be fixed by making the parafoils bigger. This week, hawk-eyed SpaceX fans noticed that Mr. Steven was traveling to a special location in the Pacific Ocean to get in position for today’s launch. And those tracking the ship’s whereabouts online yesterday found that Mr. Steven’s final destination had been relabeled to “Your Mom’s House. ” \n \nAs for the launch, it’s one that SpaceX has done many times before. The company holds a contract to launch 75 of Iridium’s NEXT satellites into lower Earth orbit, to replace an existing constellation. Of those, 66 will make up the primary NEXT constellation, providing comprehensive telecommunications services to the US government and commercial companies, while nine additional satellites will serve as backups in orbit. SpaceX has been launching these satellites in batches of 10, and this will be the fifth set to go into space. In fact, the same Falcon 9 rocket going up today was used to launch the third group of Iridium NEXT satellites back in October . \n \nSpaceX has an instantaneous launch window for this mission set for 10:13AM ET, so the rocket has to go up at that exact time or fly another day. The company has a backup launch date set for Saturday at 10:08AM ET. But so far, weather seems to be looking good for a launch today, according to Iridium’s CEO Matt Desch . SpaceX’s livestream will begin about 15 minutes before take off. And don’t worry, if you can’t catch this mission today, just wait until Monday for the next Falcon 9 launch ."}

{"articleID":33704446078,"title":"","content":"/PRNewswire/ -- Solera Health, a leading integrated benefit network, today announced the launch of MedicareDPP.org, a national referral and selection website for the new Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP). The site's goal is to increase awareness of and participation in diabetes prevention programs by making it easy for Medicare beneficiaries to learn their risk for type 2 diabetes, and if eligible, find and participate in a local diabetes prevention program that fits their needs and preferences. Effective as of April 1, the MDPP is a milestone in the history of Medicare. For the first time, an estimated 22 million Medicare beneficiaries at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes have access to evidence-based, diabetes prevention services at no cost. The MDPP, which aims to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes through a two-year program, is the culmination of years of work across government agencies to scale the National Diabetes Prevention Program. This has included research from the National Institutes of Health, the translation of that research into community-based programming by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the completion of the MDPP expanded model pilot and actuarial analysis by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and now the addition of MDPP as a covered preventive service by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nMedicareDPP.org is a user-friendly portal that seamlessly guides individuals through eligibility verification, blood value collection, and the MDPP selection process. Once eligibility is verified, the site connects the beneficiary to non-medical, community-based MDPP suppliers that meet CDC and CMS requirements. Solera is contracted to administer the MDPP for more than 32 Medicare Advantage plans, however the website is designed to verify eligibility and match all eligible Medicare beneficiaries with MDPP suppliers. \n\nSponsored by: \"The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program can reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes by up to 70% and provide a positive financial return of $2,650 in 12 to 14 months,\"1 said Brenda Schmidt, CEO of Solera Health. \"Through MedicareDPP.org, Solera functions like a dating or travel website to find the best diabetes prevention program for Medicare members to help them live healthier lives. We are excited to work with our MDPP network partners to achieve this goal.\"\n\nAbout Solera Health\n\nSolera Health is an integrated benefit network that connects patients, payers, and physicians with community organizations and digital therapeutics providers, simply and securely. Solera helps consolidate highly fragmented non-medical programs and services into one integrated network, allowing health plans and medical providers to increase consumer participation while lowering associated costs. Solera proactively identifies the \"best fit\" program provider based on each individual's unique needs and preferences, which has proven to have a significant impact on improved patient outcomes at a fraction of the cost of traditional medical care.

{"articleID":33440708162,"title":"IPhone X Was Supposed to Start OLED Boom. It's Not Working Out","content":"The Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n\n(Bloomberg) -- A bright future lies ahead for OLED. When that starts, and how long it lasts, is less clear. \n\nOrganic light-emitting diode screens have been touted as the future of smartphones because they’re crisper and easier on batteries than their liquid-crystal predecessors. Late last year, as Apple Inc. prepared its OLED iPhone X, suppliers led by Samsung Electronics Co. rushed to ramp up production. \n\nNow, there’s concern about over-supply and price cuts. The iPhone X didn’t sell as well as Wall Street anticipated and Samsung, the top OLED supplier, expects to ship about half the units planned to Apple, according to people familiar with the situation. The South Korean company sees 2018 operating profit from displays coming in short of some analysts’ forecasts, the people also said. Samsung declined to comment.  \n\nChinese phone makers may adopt the technology and prop up demand, but that’s unlikely any time soon. \n\n“Cutting prices would be a carrot to appeal to Chinese vendors and deal with the excessive capacity,” said Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities in Seoul. “The OLED market is shrinking this year, but I’d say ‘no’ to pessimism for next year and the year after. Now’s the time for Samsung to tough it out.” \n\nSamsung remains committed to OLED and doesn’t yet feel pressure to cut its panel prices, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing an internal business matter. Samsung is pinning some of its OLED hopes on a successful launch of the Galaxy S9 smartphone line and a future model with a foldable screen. Apple plans to release a giant iPhone with the displays later this year. \n\nSamsung’s display subsidiary is one of the few manufacturers capable of churning out tens of millions of OLED panels each year for both itself and Apple. LG Display Co. has begun ramping up its own OLED efforts: It supplies screens for some Google phones and is in line to supply some to Apple in the future. \n\nBut a number of smartphone makers, particularly in China, don’t yet use OLED widely. \n\n\"The basic expectation has been that other vendors would seek to move to OLED based displays once capacity was available,\" Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities Ltd., wrote in a note to investors. But Samsung’s recent problems suggest \"the likes of Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Huawei are clearly in no rush to shift to OLED.\" \n\nThe main sticking point has been price. Each 5.5-inch LCD screen used in the iPhone 8 Plus costs Apple $52, whereas the iPhone X’s 5.8-inch OLED display is $110, researcher IHS Markit estimates. Those prices should go up in the near term as Apple sources larger screens for its upcoming nearly 6.5-inch model. \n\nSome phone makers may be delaying the switch to OLED due to recent advancements in older LCD technology, which Apple still uses in almost all its other devices.  \n\n\"LCD is fine enough for many users, and the price difference between OLED and LCD is still there,\" said Simon Chan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \n\nOLED has also caused problems for those who do use it. When Google launched a new Pixel smartphone last year with the technology, some users complained about inaccurate color reproduction and burn-in, where images remain after the screen is turned off. Apple warns on its website that burn-in and slight color changes are \"characteristic\" of OLED panels. \n\n\"OLED has only survived because Samsung, Apple and LG Display, which have deep pockets, have kept it going,\" said Raymond Soneira, chief executive officer of DisplayMate Technologies Corp., which tests screens. \"When I started looking at OLEDs a few years ago, they were at the bottom of the performance list.\" \n\nUniversal Display Corp., which sells OLED-related chemicals to manufacturers like Samsung, missed on its revenue guidance for 2018, sending the shares down 16 percent on Feb. 23. Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Andrew Uerkwitz warned of \"more volatile mobile display market dynamics\" and increased competition from cheaper LCDs, while Evercore ISI’s C.J. Muse said the market has shifted from euphoria on supply deals to uncertainty. \n\n“We expect industry capacity growth to take a bit of a breather this year as panel makers build the framework for the next wave of high-volume OLED production, which is expected to ramp next year,\" Sidney Rosenblatt, Universal Display’s chief financial officer, said. “2019 is poised to be a meaningful year of growth.” \n\nOLED will likely keep improving as costs come down and production increases. The results are already emerging. Last year, DisplayMate ranked the iPhone X’s OLED screen as the best of any smartphone. Samsung’s new S9 line just topped that. \n\nA longer-term threat is MicroLED, which has many of the benefits of OLED, but fewer drawbacks. In 2015, Apple opened a lab in Taiwan to work on new screen technologies, Bloomberg News reported at the time. Foxconn Technology Group, the biggest assembler of iPhones for Apple, has backed MicroLED startup eLux Inc . In 2014, Apple acquired LuxVue Technology Corp., a MicroLED maker. \n\nThe new technology is already being showcased in some high-end TVs. At the CES consumer electronics conference in January, Samsung demonstrated a 146-inch MicroLED TV dubbed \"The Wall\" because of its size. MicroLED is more energy efficient and brighter than OLED and lasts longer without burn-in, but yields are lower and sharpness is inferior for now, according to Soneira. \n\n\"MicroLED screens aren’t close to production for smartphones and smartwatches\" and it will take \"at least three to five years for OLED to be dislodged,\" he said. \n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu \n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net, Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.net. \n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robert Fenner at rfenner@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr \n\n©2018 Bloomberg L.P. \n\nThe Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n.

That means building a management team, securing regulatory approvals, finalizing product offerings, refining the sales strategy and developing a multiyear roadmap to build a more member-centric experience. \n \nAetna and other insurers have been teaming up with hospital companies around the nation to form joint ventures for several reasons: Insurers want to expand their market strength while hospital CEOs hope to get greater control over the size of premiums they will get. And, under the Affordable Care Act, payments will be based on performance rather than fee-for-service. \n \nConsequently, these new ventures are looking to improve the health outcomes for a large population at a lower cost than their competitors can offer. Some hospital companies have purchased insurance companies as a way of reinventing themselves for this new era, and others have tried to integrate insurance capabilities into what they offer.

Toys 'R' Us, which has roughly 33,000 full- and part-time U.S. employees, was already in the process of closing one fifth of its stores as part of efforts to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer.\n\nEfforts collapsed this month after lenders decided, absent a clear reorganization plan, they could recover more in a liquidation, closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales, sources with knowledge of the matter said.\n\n\"I have always believed that this brand and this business should exist in the U.S.,\" Brandon said on a conference call with staff, the Wall Street Journal said.\n\nThe retailer is likely to liquidate in France, Spain, Poland and Australia, Brandon said, according the newspaper.

{"articleID":33513589141,"title":"AI takes root across agencies","content":"When House members and agency executives gathered on Capitol Hill March 7 to talk about how artificial intelligence could benefit the public sector, legislators focused their comments on the president's budget, which cuts research and development funding. \n \n“Outside of the Department of Defense, the president’s budget proposes an overall cut to research and development of 21.2 percent,” Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) said in her opening statement at the hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform's  Subcommittee on Information Technology. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) agreed the cuts were worrying: “I tremble at what we are cutting.” \n \nThe subcommittee did hear from witnesses who described their agencies' AI projects. \n \nThe General Services Administration, for instance, is exploring how robotic process automation can offload compliance monitoring tasks from employees, Keith Nakasone, the deputy assistant commissioner of Information Technology Category Acquisition Management within GSA, explained in his testimony. \n \nGSA's Solicitation Review Tool predicts regulatory compliance by using \"natural language processing, text mining, and machine learning algorithms to automatically predict whether federal solicitations posted on fbo.gov are compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act,\" Nakasone testified. If filings are found to be out of compliance, the tool alerts responsible parties so corrections can be made.  “Through independent review, the predictions have an accuracy rate of 95 percent,” he added. \n \nThe tool is expected to go into production on cloud.gov this spring. \n \nGSA also has built a team focused on robotic process automation that will provide governance for these new technologies, including common architectures. \n \nAI has shown potential to help agencies improve cybersecurity by predicting malware evolution, according to Douglas Maughan, the director of the Cybersecurity Division at the Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency. \n \nAdditionally, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate built \"a machine learning-based policy engine capable of blocking more than 120,000 calls a month, including robo calls,” he told lawmakers. “This same technology can be used defend 911 centers against life threatening distributed denial of service attacks” that overwhelm emergency call centers with fraudulent calls. \n \nAt the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Explainable Artificial Intelligence program aims to create machine-learning systems that can better describe how they came to their conclusions. This will help alleviate some of the trust issues associated with AI technologies, said John O. Everett, the deputy director of the DARPA Information Innovation Office \n \nFuture research that will be vital, he said, will be providing computers with common sense, which will require helping them better understand how intonation and facial expressions provide context for speech. \n \nTo end the hearing, Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) asked panelists what the equivalent of going to the moon is for AI. \n \nToday we have narrow AI, which is image recognition and speech recognition, but the next big step will be general AI, said James F. Kurose, the assistant director of Computer Science and Information Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. \n \n“Look at, for instance, what an 18-month-old child can do and how the child can transfer learning from one environment to another, how a child can understand intent and meaning,” he said. “That’s really the grand challenge.

Image: Mark Brake/  By Keith Wagstaff 2018-03-29 23:59:26 UTC  \nElon Musk's SpaceX just got permission to operate 4,425 satellites that could one day provide internet service from space.  \n \nThat would vastly increase access to the internet — especially in rural areas — and possibly create a ton of space junk .  \n \nNot that SpaceX is anywhere near ready to flip the switch on a new internet service. So far, it's only launched two demo satellites. But this is a big step forward.  \n \nIn a statement released Thursday, the FCC said it was the first approval of \"a U.S.-licensed satellite constellation to provide broadband services using a new generation of low-Earth orbit satellite technologies.\" \n \nYes, satellite internet does exist — but it involves satellites orbiting very high above the Earth, around 22,000 miles. That's why it's so laggy and slow. Musk wants to solve that problem by launching satellites into low-Earth orbit, lower than 1,000 miles up. But those satellites can't provide enough coverage, which is why SpaceX wants to launch thousands of them.  \n \nThat's good news for people in remote areas. Instead of having to build expensive broadband cables to serve only a few people, internet service providers could build towers that receive signals from SpaceX's satellites, and then beam those signals to customers.  \n \nThe downside is that Earth's orbit could get crowded fast, with collisions causing collisions in a cascading disaster.

{"articleID":33510223103,"title":"QualtricsLeapfrogs Reactive Customer and Employee Experience Tools with New Prescriptive Offering","content":"SALT LAKE CITY and SEATTLE, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualtrics, the leader in experience management, today announced significant enhancements to its award-winning Qualtrics Experience Management (XM) Platform™, making it easier than ever for organizations to close experience gaps––the difference between what organizations think they are delivering and what customers and employees actually experience. With the launch of the iQ Directory, Qualtrics now offers organizations a single-system-of-record for all experience data. Powered by a layer of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the iQ Directory enables advanced, intelligent features throughout the Qualtrics XM platform––including predictive capabilities that forecast individual behavior such as employee attrition and customer churn. The announcement was made today at the Qualtrics 2018 X4 Experience Management Summit in Salt Lake City. Based on over 15 years of leadership in the insights and analytics industry, Qualtrics announced the revolutionary XM Platform one year ago. Used by over 75 percent of the Fortune 100 and 99 of the top 100 U.S. business schools, the Qualtrics XM Platform helps companies like Allianz, JetBlue, Microsoft and Yamaha measure, prioritize, and optimize the experiences they deliver across the four core experiences of business—customer, product, employee and brand experiences.\n\n\"The experiences companies deliver are more important today than they have ever been. Customers don't just buy a product anymore, they buy an experience. And it is the experience companies provide that makes or breaks a brand,\" said Ryan Smith, co-founder and CEO of Qualtrics. \"Similarly, employees don't want a job description where they are cogs in a machine. They want their work to be an experience they can talk about and share. Companies today essentially compete on the experiences they provide and they are turning to the XM Platform to help them measure, improve, and act on these key experience programs.\"\n\nTwo enhancements to the Qualtrics Experience Management Platform announced today include important extensions to the —a collection of advanced, intelligent features built on artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics to improve the experiences organizations deliver. The newest elements of Qualtrics iQ include the iQ Directory and Predict iQ:\n\n1. iQ Directory: \n\nThe Qualtrics iQ Directory is a live, organized chronicle that captures the emotions, sentiments, beliefs and preferences of an audience. The iQ Directory contains all experience data, or X-data, collected over time, creating a system of record of all interactions and opinions each person has of an organization. \n\niQ Directory enables a company to take a person-centric view, helping companies gain a better understanding of an individual person's unique journey with the company. Because each new interaction builds upon past information, this rich collection of experience data makes new interactions smarter over time, allowing a brand to customize future touch points for each group based on past preferences and therefore ensuring a better overall experience.\n\nAs the iQ Directory is now recorded as transactional data with each data point providing a record of each interaction throughout the individual's journey, it is possible to pinpoint key drivers and changes in sentiment over time. The application of machine learning helps predict how an individual might respond in a certain situation, empowering a company to be predictive in its outreach rather than just reactive.\n\nThe Qualtrics iQ Directory enables companies to interact with people at the right moment, with the right message, via the best channels, making interactions feel like an ongoing conversation rather than transactional pings along a customer or employee journey.\n\n2. Predict iQ: \n\nPredict iQ helps companies understand which customers are likely to leave and what they can do to prevent customer attrition before it happens. Using neural network, open-source algorithms to make its predictions, Predict iQ utilizes Qualtrics Actions, allowing users to set up triggers to send emails, create tickets, or ping any third-party service for immediate action to be taken when needed. Easy-to-use and requiring only minutes to set up, Predict iQ makes deep learning accessible to anyone.\n\nPredict iQ centralizes all churn analysis and reduction efforts in one place and is deeply integrated into existing feedback collection, so there's no need to move data around to get predictions. Predict iQ also complements Stats iQ, allowing companies to use Stats iQ to understand and fix systemic issues while leveraging Predict iQ to save individual customers. All this can be done while larger-scale initiatives are being put in place, providing results from day one. \n\n3. Certified XM Solutions:\n\nDesigned by the world's leading researchers, practitioners and consultants, Certified XM Solutions are packaged projects and programs with expert content, workflow, and automation––built directly into the Qualtrics platform. These community-driven solutions provide complete industry-specific experience management programs including everything from best practices, to content, to technical implementation, to survey design, to contact frequency guidance, to data analysis, and recommended next steps. \n\nQualtrics Certified XM Solutions currently include experience management solutions that span employee engagement solutions, customer experience solutions, product and brand experience solutions for many industries including financial services, education, government, retail, B2B, and more.Qualtrics Certified XM Solutions are designed to reduce the time, risk and cost of implementing an experience management program from the ground up.

Power, Kantar TNS and Walker Information.

{"articleID":33683110214,"title":"Out of this world: Inside Japan’s space colony centre","content":"Tokyo (AFP) – A newly created Space Colony Research centre led by Japan’s first female astronaut is bringing cutting-edge technology to bear on one of mankind’s greatest questions: Can we live in space? \n \nTucked away in high-tech laboratories at the Tokyo University of Science, a team of 30 researchers directed by Chiaki Mukai are studying new ways to keep humans alive on a potential moon or Mars colony. \n \n“It’s in our nature to explore. The Earth is too small for us, don’t you think?” asked Mukai, a petite and energetic 66-year-old who spent more than 500 hours in space on two separate missions. \n \nHuman space exploration is entering a new era, said Mukai, with commercial ventures like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and US President Donald Trump’s pledge to explore beyond the moon and towards Mars. \n \nBillionaire entrepreneur Musk has grand visions for private space exploration, including sending tourists into orbit around the moon and eventually colonising Mars. \n \nIn December, Trump directed US space agency NASA to set up a lunar base as a first step in a mission to Mars. \n \n“It’s very realistic to establish a colony on the moon by 2030,” said Mukai, who said humans needed to think beyond the International Space Station, which she described as a “campsite — you have to bring everything with you”. \n \nOne of her team’s innovations is a unique food production system using liquid plasma created by passing high-voltage electricity through a saline solution. \n \nThis reduces the damaging algae usually formed in water when growing crops, and tests simulating conditions in space have shown that potatoes can be grown quicker and more efficiently using this system. \n \nThe Space Colony Research Centre has also developed a system to create electricity using tiny thermoelectric sensors about the size of an iPod Nano that could be attached to a potential colony. \n \nThe colony would be kept at comfortable room temperature, but outside it would vary between 130 degrees Celsius (266 Fahrenheit) during the day and -230 at night. \n \nThe technology harnesses the difference in temperature — heat flux — between inside and outside to create enough electricity to “power an entire space colony,” said Tsutomu Lida, in charge of the project. \n \n“The same device can be used for day and night. There are no moving parts, so there is no maintenance required,” said Lida. \n \nAnother team is working on early detection and capture of space debris.  \n \nMore than 29,000 pieces measuring at least 10 centimetres (four inches) across orbit Earth and could pose a danger to potential space colonists. \n \n– Space flight attendant – \n \nMukai, who established the centre as part of the Tokyo University of Science at the beginning of the year, said many of the technologies they are working on have applications here on Earth. \n \n“We are not only developing the technology for a moon base but as a spin-off, we will be able to help many issues that we need to solve on Earth,” she said. \n \nFor example, she said hydroponic technology — growing food without soil — could be valuable in countries in parts of sub-Saharan Africa lacking natural resources and minerals. \n \nMukai said she was “certain” she would see a fully-functioning moon colony in her lifetime and was itching to go back into space, taking as her example former colleague and US astronaut John Glenn, who went into orbit aged 77. \n \nThe former heart surgeon said that with her medical expertise and extra-terrestrial experience, she could be very useful on future commercial space tourism flights. \n \n“My dream is to get a job as a flight attendant on a commercial spaceflight so I can help to get people to the moon,” she said, laughing."}

Among the report's most notable findings, threat intelligence from Firebox appliances protecting small and midsize businesses (SMBs) and distributed enterprises around the world showed that total malware attacks are up by 33 percent, and that cyber criminals are increasingly leveraging Microsoft Office documents to deliver malicious payloads. WatchGuard has also launched a new , available for the public to access to daily updates about the most prevalent computer and network security threats affecting SMBs and distributed enterprises. \"After a full year of collecting and analyzing Firebox Feed data, we can clearly see that cyber criminals are continuing to leverage sophisticated, evasive attacks and resourceful malware delivery schemes to steal valuable data,\" said Corey Nachreiner, chief technology officer at WatchGuard Technologies. \"Although these criminal tactics may vary over time, we can be certain that this broad trend will persist, so the risks have never been greater for small and midsize organizations with less IT and security resources. We encourage businesses of all sizes to proactively mitigate these threats with layered security services, advanced malware protection, and employee education and training in security best practices.\" WatchGuard's provides a quarterly update on the most ubiquitous security threats targeting businesses today, as well key strategies they can use to protect employees, customers and stakeholders from data theft. The top takeaways from the Q4 2017 report include:\n\nCyber criminals leveraged malicious Office documents to trick victims. Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) attacks cracked WatchGuard's top ten malware list in Q4, as hackers increasingly exploited issues within this Microsoft Office standard to execute code. Also called \"macro-less malware,\" these malicious documents often use PowerShell and obfuscated script to get past network defenses. Additionally, two of the top-ten network attacks in Q4 involved Microsoft Office exploits, further emphasizing the growing trend of malicious document attacks. Overall malware attacks grew significantly, while zero day malware variants jumped 167 percent. WatchGuard Fireboxes blocked over 30 million total malware variants in Q4, which was a 33 percent increase over the previous quarter. Out of the total threats prevented in Q4, the subset of new or \"zero day\" malware instances rose steeply by 167 percent compared to Q3. These increases can likely be attributed to heightened criminal activity during the holiday season. Nearly half of all malware eluded basic antivirus (AV) solutions. WatchGuard Fireboxes block malware using both legacy signature-based detection techniques and the modern, proactive behavioral detection solution – . When catches a malware variant, it means the legacy AV signatures missed it. This zero day malware accounted for 46 percent of all malware in Q4. That level of growth suggests criminals are using more sophisticated evasion techniques capable of slipping attacks past traditional AV services, which further underscores the importance of behavior-based defenses. Scripting attacks account for 48 percent of top malware. Script-based attacks caught by signatures for JavaScript and Visual Basic Script threats, such as downloaders and droppers, accounted for the majority of malware detected in Q4. Users should take note of the continued popularity of these attacks and watch out for malicious script in web pages and email attachments of any kind. The full features evaluations of the quarter's most pervasive malware and network attacks, recommendations for useful defensive strategies in today's threat landscape, and a detailed breakdown of \"the Krack Attack\" – one of the top information security issues in 2017. \n\nAdditionally, the report includes a new research project from the WatchGuard Threat Lab, which analyzes a database of more than 1 billion stolen password records to stress just how often users choose weak passwords and re-use credentials across multiple accounts. This quarter's conclusions are based on anonymized Firebox Feed data from nearly 40,000 active WatchGuard Fireboxes worldwide, which blocked more than 30 million malware variants (783 per device) and 6.9 million network attacks (178 per device) in Q4 2017. \n\nNew Threat Landscape Data Visualization ToolWatchGuard's new offers daily security insights regarding the top malware and network attacks around the globe.

Other sectors experienced an average of between 26% and 30% of ICS computers attacked. The vast majority of detected attacks were accidental hits. \n \nAccording to experts, the energy sector was one of the first industries that started to widely use various automation solutions and is now one of the most computerised. Cyber security incidents and targeted attacks over the past couple of years, along with regulatory initiatives make a strong case for the power and energy companies to start adopting cyber security products and measures for their operational technology (OT) systems. \n \nMoreover, the modern power grid is one of the most extensive systems of interconnected industrial objects, with a large number of computers connected to the network and a relatively high degree of exposure to cyber threats, as demonstrated by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT statistics. In turn, the high percentage of attacked ICS computers in engineering and ICS Integration businesses is another serious problem given the fact that the supply chain attack vector has been used in some devastating attacks in recent years. \n \nAmong the new trends of 2017, Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT researchers have discovered a rise in mining attacks on ICS that began in September, following an increase in the cryptocurrency market and miners in general. This type of attack can pose a greater threat for industrial enterprises by creating a significant load on computers and, as a result, negatively affecting the operation of the enterprise's ICS components and threatening their stability. Overall, during the period from February 2017 to January 2018, cryptocurrency mining programs attacked 3.3% of industrial automation system computers, in most cases accidentally. \n \n \"The results of our research into attacked ICS computers in various industries have surprised us. For example, the high percentage of ICS computers attacked in power and energy companies demonstrated that the enterprises' effort to ensure cyber security of their automation systems after some serious incidents in the industry is not enough, and there are multiple loopholes still there that cyber criminals can use,\" said Evgeny Goncharov, head of Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT. \n \n\"Overall, in comparison with 2016 we have seen a slight decline in the number of ICS attacks. This probably indicates that, generally, enterprises have started to pay a bit more attention to ICS cyber security issues, and are auditing the industrial segments of their networks, training employees, etc. It is a good sign, because it's highly important for businesses to take proactive measures in order to avoid firefighting in future,\" he adds. \n \nKaspersky Lab ICS CERT recommends the following technical measures to be taken: \n Regularly update operating systems, application software and security solutions on systems that are part of the enterprise's industrial network.  Restrict network traffic on ports and protocols used on the edge routers and inside organisation's OT networks.  Audit ICS component access control in the enterprise's industrial network and at its boundaries.  Deploy dedicated endpoint protection solutions onto ICS servers, workstations and HMIs to secure OT and industrial infrastructure from random cyber attacks.  Deploy network traffic monitoring, analysis and detection solutions for better protection from targeted attacks.  \nYou can read the full report here ."}
{"articleID":33578158766,"title":"Arcadia Biosciences Achieves Key Resistant Starch Wheat Technology Milestones","content":"Source: Arcadia Biosciences news release \nArcadia Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKDA), an agricultural technology company, today announced that it has achieved two key technology milestones in its High Fiber Resistant Starch (RS) Wheat program. First, through advanced screening and traditional breeding techniques, the company has developed non-transgenic (non-GM) wheat varieties that contain up to 94 percent amylose, the highest levels available. \n\nIncreased levels of amylose correspond to high levels of resistant starch, which has been proven to deliver significant health benefits. Second, these same wheat varieties deliver levels of total dietary fiber high enough to meet the threshold required by the US Food and Drug Administration for a \"Good Source\" of fiber or \"High in Fiber\" designation on consumer packaging. \n\n\"Arcadia's new wheat varieties will allow people to enjoy the foods they love with the health benefits of resistant starch and dietary fiber, while satisfying consumer demand for clean-label, natural foods.\" \n\n\"These milestones are key achievements in the commercial launch plan for our non-GM wheat ingredients portfolio, delivering health benefits to consumers and distinct market differentiators to consumer packaged goods companies,\" said Raj Ketkar, president and CEO of Arcadia Biosciences. \"Arcadia's new wheat varieties will allow people to enjoy the foods they love with the health benefits of resistant starch and dietary fiber, while satisfying consumer demand for clean-label, natural foods.\" \n\nArcadia is working with a select number of consumer packaged goods companies on new, healthier formulations of existing products using both enriched and whole wheat RS Wheat flour. The company is preparing for an increase in acres planted during the upcoming US wheat growing season. \nResistant starch has many benefits compared to other types of starch, particularly in the management of gastrointestinal health and obesity-related health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. \n\nIt contains higher amounts of amylose, a carbohydrate molecule that is less vulnerable to digestion. Because it is digested more slowly, resistant starch has a lower glycemic index, meaning it does not cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels. Resistant starch also acts as a nondigestible prebiotic that promotes the growth of \"good bacteria\" (probiotics) that improve gut health. \n\nSome of the additional reported health benefits of resistant starch include: \n\n- Increased absorption of calcium and other key minerals \n\n- Improved weight loss through increased feeling of satiety \n\n- Increased insulin sensitivity - helpful for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity and Alzheimer's disease \n\n- Increased production of butyrate - an anti-inflammatory which may help burn body fat and recently consumed fat. \n\nIn addition to the benefits of resistant starch, Arcadia's RS Wheat varieties produce refined flour and whole grain flour that is naturally high in fiber. Many products marketed as \"high fiber\" contain fiber additives, such as inulin, cellulose and psyllium husk. Arcadia's RS Wheat has intrinsically high levels of fiber and can enable food companies to reduce the use of added fiber sources in their formulations to simplify their ingredient labels. \n\nWheat flour is a major part of people's diets on a global level. In 2015, the global wheat flour market was valued at $200 billion and is estimated to reach a value of $270 billion by 2022. On average, one quarter, or 500 calories, of Americans' daily caloric intake comes from wheat. \n\nArcadia's RS Wheat varieties have the opportunity to provide additional, proven health benefits for consumers who want to continue to enjoy the wheat-based foods they love."}

Acronis becomes a Google reseller. Acronis will also extend support for Google Cloud workloads, offer a Google Cloud deployment model for the Acronis Backup management server, and enable the use of Google Cloud Platform for disaster recovery . Specific integrations with Acronis backup solutions, as well as Acronis support for Google’s G Suite, will be coming soon. \n \n“This is a very significant announcement for us,” said John Zanni, Acronis’ President, “Google Cloud is a widely used product – from very small business all the way to large enterprises. However, many small and medium businesses show a preference for it, and this happens to be our sweet spot in the market, which makes it a no-brainer choice. Google has a market with larger channels – telcos – and we will work with Google in those channels as well and offer them our backup capabilities.” Google also has a significant number of mid-market customers, and Acronis expects to increase their penetration here as well. \n \nThe integration will mean faster upload speeds for customers, as well as an increase in the number of cloud regions where Acronis’ partners and customers can store their data, to accommodate both regulations and customer preferences around data sovereignty. It should also help users reduce their Recovery Time Objectives and achieve Service Level Agreement targets, especially in disaster recovery situations. \n \n“It also means that customers and partners both have additional flexibility to store and backup their data,” Zanni said. “By working more closely with Google, we create a much richer experience for them as well.” \n \nZanni noted that many of their existing customers had specifically asked for this integration, in order to increase their options, and that Acronis expects it to attract new customers too. \n \n“We believe that this will bring in a significant number of folks by offering them best-in-class backup solutions with this public cloud,” he said. \n \nThe partnership is in place.

State and think, “Why can’t we do that?” \n \nThe Wolfpack are on the cusp of returning to the NCAA tournament. They beat Duke this season and split with North Carolina. They’re fast, fearless and fun to watch. \n \nThey’re doing this with a first-year head coach, Kevin Keatts. N.C. State found Keatts at UNC Wilmington, where twice in three seasons (his last two) he made the NCAA tournament. \n \nThe Wolfpack was not in the basketball gutter to the extent the 49ers are. They made the NCAA tournament in 2012, ’13, ’14 and ’15. \n \nThe 49ers last made the NCAA tournament in 2005. The trip was practically annual then. Under Bobby Lutz, they went in 1998, ’99, ’01, ’02, ’04 and ’05. \n \nThen their conference disintegrated. The chosen ones, the schools with basketball and football and a desirable market, joined the Big East. The 49ers, which lacked football, scrambled to find a home, and joined the Atlantic 10. \n \nThe A-10 never worked. Lutz was muted, didn’t make the tournament again and was released in 2010. \n \nSince then, the 49ers have been a basketball wasteland. This season they’re 5-22, 1-15 in Conference USA and 0-2 in coaches. They fired Mark Price in December and replaced him with assistant Houston Fancher. The hastiness with which they fired Price is the only quickness the 49ers have shown all season. \n \nAlumni, students and fans deserve more than this. Now that the 49ers have an athletic director, they need to find a basketball coach. Maybe, like N.C. State, they’ll stay close to home and look at the coaches at Winthrop and Wofford. Maybe they’ll consider Lutz. He was good before and, after a layoff as a head coach, he’ll be better. Maybe they’ll go national. \n \nCharlotte’s last two coaches had no collegiate head-coaching experience. Mark Price might have made it; he was canned so quickly we’ll never know. Could he recruit? We’ll never know that, either. \n \nSo hire a man that we know can. The 49ers can’t guess this time. Find somebody like Keatts, whose confidence is absolute. He’s earned the right to be confident. \n \nThe 2018 men’s NCAA tournament, perhaps the finest end to a season in U.S. sports, will be the 13th straight in which the 49ers have not participated. \n \nThe closest Charlotte fans will get is Spectrum Center. The 49ers will host first- and second-round games there. \n More from this issue of the Tom Talks newsletter"}

Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the expenses associated with Asure's earnings results as determined in accordance with GAAP. However, for the reasons described below, management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of Asure's business. Asure's management believes that it is important to provide investors with these same tools, together with reconciliation to GAAP, for evaluating the performance of Asure's business, as it may provide additional insight into Asure's financial results.

Since the introduction of the EOS 5D Mark II DSLR camera in 2008, Canon has been a part of the full-frame video movement, and the introduction of the C700 FF has reinforced Canon's commitment to this market.  At the heart of the camera is a novel Canon-developed CMOS image sensor having a total of 5952 (H) x 3140 (V) photosites with a digital cinema 17:9 aspect ratio, which gives it the same image circle size as the full frame EOS 5D camera series.   This supports a wide range of shooting options. \n  \n\n  \nAvailable in both PL and EF Mount, the EOS C700 FF provides users with the same outstanding performance, operation and modular design as the EOS C700 (released in December 2016 ). The camera is being shown publicly for the first time at the Canon booth (C4325) at the NAB Show 2018 in Las Vegas from April 9-12 . \n        \n\"Since the launch of Canon's Cinema EOS line of products in November 2011 , the goal was to one day develop a cinema camera worthy of being the 'A' camera on major Hollywood productions, and Canon met that goal with the introduction of the EOS C700,\" said Yuichi Ishizuka , president and COO, Canon U.S.A. , Inc. \"After listening to our customers and closely monitoring market trends, Canon set forth a new goal: to launch a full-frame cinema camera. With this introduction, we are very excited to see the C700 FF in the hands of industry professionals as they shoot their latest projects.\" \n \nExisting owners of Canon's original EOS C700 cinema camera will be pleased to know they can have their Super 35mm sensor upgraded to the new Full-Frame sensor for a fee*.  Authorized Canon facilities such as Canon Burbank are ready to process C700 upgrades as well as lens mount swaps, and offer equipment drop off, on-site repairs and upgrades, as well as equipment testing and demonstration. \n \nThe Sensor \n \nThe newly developed sensor featured in the EOS C700 FF has an active image area of  38.1 x 20.1mm and supports readout at full size, as well as Super 35mm, Super 16mm and anamorphic modes. In addition to full-frame lenses, it can be used with conventional Super 35mm lenses to originate 4K / UHD standardized production formats and Super 16mm lenses (with an adapter) to originate 2K / HD production formats in crop modes. The sensor captures wide tonality exceeding 15 stops of dynamic range and a wide color gamut meeting ITU-R BT.2020 standards. This offers broad latitude when grading, providing outstanding effectiveness in HDR video production. \n \nRecording \n \nThe EOS C700 FF embodies a choice of two high-performance codecs for on-board recording –Canon XF-AVC or Apple ProRes. Like other cameras in the 4K Cinema EOS family, the EOS C700 FF uses CFast cards to capture 4K / UHD or 2K / HD.  A striking feature of the C700 FF is the Oversampling 4K Processing that processes a 5.9K image capture to produce 4K (DCI or UHD) having enhanced image sharpness, curtailed moire, and a lowered visibility of noise at the higher ISO settings. This is especially advantageous for on-board anamorphic image capture.     Low-rate 2K /HD proxy data including metadata, can be recorded to SD cards, ideal for offline editing. The camera also allows high-frame-rate recording of up to 168fps in 2K crop and relay or simultaneous recording onto both CFast cards. In addition, the C700 FF can shoot at a Full HD high-frame-rate recording at a maximum of 168 fps. Additional formats are planned with future firmware updates. \n \nTo further complement the features of the EOS C700 FF, Canon has turned to its trusted partner Codex to provide a fully integrated (no cables) recording and workflow option. The combination of the optional Codex CDX-36150 recorder docked onto the back of the EOS C700 FF enables 5.9K 60 fps RAW recording, 4K RAW up to 72 fps (in 24p mode), 4K ProRes up to 60 fps and 2K ProRes up to 168 fps (in Super 16mm mode). \n \nThe C700 FF also supports the latest version (1.0) of the ACESproxy, the ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) color management transmission standard. \n \nHDR \n \nFor users looking to create High Dynamic Range (HDR) imagery, the EOS C700 FF is an excellent solution, providing 15 stops of latitude (with Canon Log2 only), along with Canon's proprietary Log Gammas (Canon Log3, Canon Log2 and Canon Log) and renowned color science. Canon Log2 is recommended when originating HDR imagery containing both highlight details and deep shadowed details.   In comparison with Canon Log, Canon Log3 offers a wider dynamic range while retaining performance in darker regions. \n \nAdditionally, these cameras seamlessly integrate with Canon's latest professional 4K UHD Reference Displays for on-set review and color management that conforms to SMPTE ST 2084 standards of HDR display. \n \nThe look of a cinematic production begins with the lens, and the EOS C700 FF offers both PL and EF lens mount options which are interchangeable at a Canon authorized service center. For full frame imaging, the EF lens mount version of the new EOS C700 FF is compatible with Canon's family of seven Cinema Prime lenses, including the newly announced CN-E20mm T1.5 L F lens, as well as the diverse lineup of over 70 interchangeable EF lenses. The EF mount supports Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology and Dual Pixel Focus Guide. The Focus Guide assists operators with a precision visual indicator in the viewfinder when pulling focus. Alternatively, for certain demanding shooting situations the reliable capabilities of Dual Pixel CMOS AF can be deployed. The EOS C700 FF PL mount version is also compatible with Cooke's /i metadata communication technology. \n \nThe EOS C700 FF EF and EOS C700 FF PL are scheduled to be available in July 2018 for an estimated retail price of $33,000.00 .

{"articleID":33753376648,"title":"","content":"The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DE / NYSE: DB) has appointed Christian Sewing as Chief Executive Officer with immediate effect. He succeeds John Cryan who will leave the bank at the end of this month. \n\nAdditionally, the Supervisory Board has appointed Management Board members Garth Ritchie and Karl von Rohr as new Presidents. \n\nSewing, born in 1970, has been a member of the Management Board since January 1, 2015. He was appointed as President in March 2017. Most recently he was responsible for Deutsche Bank's Private & Commercial Bank (including Postbank) together with Frank Strauß. He was Head of Group Audit from June 2013 to February 2015, prior to which he held a number of management positions in Risk. Since joining in 1989 Sewing has worked for Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto. From 2005 until 2007, Sewing was a member of the Management Board of Deutsche Genossenschafts-Hypothekenbank. Before graduating with a diploma from the Bankakademie Bielefeld and Hamburg, he completed a bank apprenticeship at Deutsche Bank. \n\nPaul Achleitner, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, said: 'In his more than 25 years at Deutsche Bank Christian Sewing has proven himself a strong and disciplined leader. The Supervisory Board is convinced that he and his team will be able to successfully lead Deutsche Bank into a new era. We trust in the great ability of this bank and its many talents.' \n\nAchleitner thanked the departing CEO: 'Despite his relatively short tenure as CEO, John Cryan has played a critical role in the almost 150 year history of Deutsche Bank - and laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank. The Supervisory Board in general and I personally are grateful for this. However, following a comprehensive analysis we came to the conclusion that we need a new execution dynamic in the leadership of our bank.' \n\nMarcus Schenck was not available for a position in the new management team, having informed the Supervisory Board before Easter that he intends to leave the bank after this year's Annual General Meeting. Achleitner said: 'We very much regret Marcus Schenck's decision and thank him for his contribution in a crucial period for our bank. We wish him continued success for the future.' \n\nDeutsche Bank's Corporate & Investment Bank will be led by Ritchie who was previously Co-Head of the division with Schenck. The Private & Commercial Bank will be led by Strauß who was previously its Co-Head along with Sewing. Attachments"}
{"articleID":33571685381,"title":"Wipro divests data centre business to Ensono","content":"Wipro is selling its data centre hosting business to Ensono for an undisclosed sum. The deal will see 900 employees and 8 data centres transfer to Ensono. A strategic tie-up between the firms will enable Wipro to maintain access to those data centre capabilities while Wipro’s strategic focus for its core business will be around \" digital spend \" (more on this from our analysts after today's analyst conference.) \n \nWipro originally gained this data centre capability via its acquisition of Infocrossing in 2007. Back then, the Indian PurePlay (IPP) paid $600m for NASDAQ-listed Infocrossing, gaining BPO, managed messaging services, ERP managed hosting services, and infrastructure outsourcing capabilities. All but the data centre hosting business has been integrated into Wipro and will not be divested as part of this deal with Ensono.  \n \nAt the time, Wipro said the acquisition opened up “ exciting growth opportunities in the large total outsourcing space ”. To us, the move seemed to be at odds with the typical position of the IPPs who were looking to maintain an asset light approach to IT services. Furthermore, the outsourcing market of today looks very different to that of ten years ago; for several years now, the battle for outsourcers has been to maintain growth (or in some cases contain a decline) in a market where contracts are much, much smaller. \n \nThe divestment is no real surprise, and we’ve seen many other players divest services and assets in the low growth areas of the data centre and end user markets. Success here requires a very ‘well oiled machine’ suited to this part of the arena where growth will in part be dependent upon taking market share. \n \nFor Ensono – which has acquired UK firms Inframon and Attenda in the past couple of years – the move beefs up its US data centre capabilities, with potential for cross-sell and upsell opportunities for both firms."}

{"articleID":33501638201,"title":"Bonds Are Helping These Gulf States Keep Their Heads in the Sand","content":"The Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n\n(Bloomberg) -- Access to a debt market teeming with yield-hungry investors is helping some cash-strapped nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council kick reforms down the road. \n\nTaking advantage of attractive interest rates, Oman raised $6.5 billion in January, its biggest sale on record, to help bridge deficits. And Bahrain, the smallest of the GCC’s six nations, tapped the international bond markets for $3.6 billion in 2017. It may issue this year to help meet funding needs. \n\nJunk-rated Oman and Bahrain have the weakest finances in the GCC and face making politically unpopular decisions such as freezing public sector employment and cut spending significantly. They have been slow to implement reforms compared with their richer neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, which have slashed expenditure, rolled back some subsidies and introduced value added tax. \n\nEasy access to the bond market “is blunting the urgency for reforms, but they also have to take into account political considerations and the debate around the new social contracts they are trying to implement,” said John Sfakianakis, the director of economic research at Gulf Research Center in Riyadh. “The more they delay implementing steps to raise non-oil revenue, the more difficult it will become in an environment of rising interest rates.” \n\nHere’s a closer look at each country: \nOman \nAs oil prices more than halved in the two years through 2016, Oman’s budget deficit climbed to 21.6 percent of gross domestic product. Still, the nation was reluctant to scale back on infrastructure projects already underway because of the belief that they’ll have a positive impact on the economy, the government said in its bond prospectus in January. It instead relied on borrowing to fund the deficit, which the International Monetary Fund sees narrowing to 11.4 percent this year. \n\nOman has more than doubled its external debt in the three years through 2017, according to IMF data. Together with its sale in January, the sultanate raised $18 billion from the sale of dollar bonds since the start of 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \n\nThis isn’t to say that Oman hasn’t implemented reforms. Here’s a short list of what it has done to improve its finances: \nRaised corporate tax to 15 percent from 12 percent Reduced tax exemptions Eased fuel, electricity subsidies Deferred non-essential projects Imposed excise duties on products such as alcohol \nBut that hasn’t stopped Omanis from spending. Total expenditure in the 11 months through November 2017 is estimated to have climbed 8.5 percent from the previous year to 10.4 billion rials ($27 billion), according to the bond prospectus. \nBahrain \nFor Bahrain, selling debt has been critical to maintaining reserves. The central bank’s foreign-currency holdings dropped to a 16-year low of $1.27 billion in July before recovering in September after it tapped the bond market for $3 billion . The nation last year asked Gulf allies for financial help, according to people with knowledge of the talks. \n\nRead More: Even the Smallest Economy in Oil-Rich Gulf Is Too Big to Fail \n\nBahrain implemented some measures to trim expenditure, mainly reducing subsidies and transfers, which lowered their contribution to total expenditure to about 25 percent in 2017 from 29 percent in 2014, S&P Global Ratings said in a report in December. \n\nIt also eased spending, imposed excise tax and increased fuel prices, but the changes haven’t been enough to stabilize its debt-to-GDP, Fitch said in a report this month after it downgraded Bahrain’s credit rating deeper into junk. \n\nHere are some of the issues: \nThe government hasn’t “identified a clear medium-term strategy to tackle high deficits and there is no clarity on a timeline towards the development of such a strategy,” Fitch said. “The political environment, embedded social expectations and a lack of experience with taxation severely constrains the government from enacting a sharper fiscal adjustment” Bahrain has about $14 billion of outstanding dollar bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which has helped boost the government’s debt-to-GDP to 91 percent last year, IMF estimates show. The fund sees it rising to 99 percent this year and 107 percent in 2019 Its fiscal deficit this year is forecast at 11.9 percent of GDP, and economic growth is set to ease to 1.7 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1989, according to the IMF \n“Further material support from the GCC would be forthcoming in case of extreme political, financial, or fiscal instability, given Bahrain’s small size and strategic importance,” Fitch said. “The expectation of such support has supported Bahrain’s market access and U.S. dollar peg despite extremely low foreign-exchange reserves.” \n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Arif Sharif in Dubai at asharif2@bloomberg.net. \n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Dana El Baltaji at delbaltaji@bloomberg.net, Shaji Mathew \n\n©2018 Bloomberg L.P. \n\nThe Smarter way to get your business news - Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp \n.

More specifically, Foley will now have a presence in Texas (Austin, Dallas and Houston), Denver and Mexico City—a gateway into Latin America to the benefit of clients and attorneys in transactional and cross-border matters. Similarly, Gardere clients and attorneys will benefit from Foley’s strong presence in the Midwest, the East and West Coasts and Florida, as well as Belgium and Tokyo. \n \n“In short, Foley and Gardere are better together,” said Jay Rothman, firm Chairman & CEO. “As the demand for legal services evolves, so must the legal providers. With that top of mind, the most important reason for this combination is the enhanced capacity it provides our attorneys to better serve our clients. We expect a seamless transition, in part because the core values of both firms overlap in significant ways, but also because Foley and Gardere have a long relationship by way of referrals, and so our clients will be able to consolidate their legal providers and tap a deeper bench of talent and expanded capabilities.” \n \nAs a result of the combination, Foley will expand geographically in several service areas including corporate, litigation, intellectual property (IP), energy, government solutions and financial restructuring and reorganization. Additionally, Foley’s energy practice will be strengthened and deepened by adding enhanced capabilities in both oil and gas and renewables, as well as infrastructure and project finance. \n \nFoley will also deepen its private equity, venture capital and IP practices to better serve clients in Texas. The robust business climate in Texas creates opportunities for the combined firm to expand its corporate, intellectual property and health care practices throughout the market, for the benefit of both clients and attorneys. \n \nThe combination also means that Gardere will have access to Foley’s extensive experience in the automotive, life sciences, sports and technology sectors – as well as its deep bench of government affairs talent in Washington, D.C. \n \n“The synergies between the firms are clear,” said Holland N. O’Neil, chair of Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP, who will be a Foley Gardere partner and a member of the combined firm’s Management Committee. “Both Foley and Gardere have historically been recognized for a commitment to client service and an ability to counsel clients through their most multifaceted legal and business challenges.

{"articleID":33586530867,"title":"Shure's $3,000 KSE1500 headphones make for an ear-opening experience","content":"For well-heeled audiophiles seeking the outer limits of transparency, the Shure KSE1500 electrostatic in-ear headphone is the one to get. \n          \nThe Shure KSE1500 is like no other headphone in my experience, they sound like a clear portal back to the recording session, there's no better way to put it. Play familiar recordings and they sound a few steps closer to what the microphones \"heard\" at the session. When you return to other high-end in-ear headphones, the sound is cloudier, more diffuse and less like being there. \n\nThe KSE1500 sounds like no other in-ear headphone because it uses completely different technology than any other in-ear headphone. It's the world's first bona-fide electrostatic in-ear headphone. Unlike dynamic and planar magnetic headphones, the KSE1500 uses an ultra lightweight diaphragm suspended between two \"stators.\" They're charged with 200 volts provided by the KSE1500's dedicated compact power amplifier, which also houses a digital converter. The headphone-amp system sells for $2,999 on Amazon in the US. That translates to about £2,549 or AU$3,999. \n\nThe amp-converter is a bit thicker than an iPhone but smaller overall. It has two inputs: a 3.5-mm jack and micro-USB you can use to hook it up to a PC, Mac, iOS or Android device. The KSE1500 comes with a USB-to-Apple Lightning cable, so I also tried listening to downloaded Tidal FLAC files on my iPhone 6S. The KSE1500 display screen shows output volume, battery level and EQ setting. \n\nThe Shure amp-digital converter build quality feels robust. The headphone's Kevlar-reinforced cable is thicker, stiffer and heavier than most in-ear headphone cables, and it's definitely not user-replaceable. Maximum playtime for the KSE1500's Lithium-Ion battery is 10 hours. The converter's maximum resolution is limited to 96-kHz (24-bit) PCM files -- nowhere as high-resolution as what's available from Astell & Kern or FiiO music players. Shure includes a handsome leather case for the amp-converter. \n   \nListening to Igor Stravinsky conducting his own composition \"The Soldier's Tale Suite,\" the purity of the sound was utterly breathtaking. Pink Floyd's early work, \"A Saucer Full of Secrets\" was a mind expanding experience. Again, it's the sense of being there, feeling like I'm breathing the same air as the musicians. You just don't get that with other in-ear headphones. \n\nFor comparison's sake I brought out an  Audeze LCDi4 planar magnetic in-ear headphones and played them with my Astell & Kern Kann portable high-res music player. So while the LCDi4 can be used with any headphone amp, the KSE1500 cannot, it must be used with its dedicated amp, it's a closed system. \n\nWith \"Catapult\" From R.E.M.'s \"Murmur\" album it was clear the LCDi4 made more and deeper bass, the KSE1500's lows were nimble, but fairly lightweight. Turning on the KSE1500's bass boost EQ setting helped bring up the bass a bit, but it still wasn't a match for the LCDi4. \n\nSince the LCDi4s are open-back headphones, the sound was more spacious than the KSE1500. But since the LCDi4 doesn't do a thing to hush external noise it's pretty useless unless you're listening in a near-silent room. The KSE1500 is a lot better in that regard as it offers a good amount of noise isolation. The LCDi4s weren't as clear and transparent, while the KSE1500s were more like being there. The Shures can also play really loud with ease. \n   \nThe LCDi4 sounded more dynamically powerful and better suited to rock, the KSE1500 was at its best with acoustic music, but it also excelled with electronica. Neither one can deliver the dynamic punch, scale, and spaciousness of a top-performing full-size headphone \n\nThe Shure KSE1500 may be the perfect headphone for well-heeled audiophiles craving the utmost in transparency in the smallest possible size. Its ability to take you deep inside a recording is extraordinary. The sound feels like there's nothing between you and the music. "}

It comes after recent trading troubles at House of Fraser and amid a dismal start to 2018 for UK retail, with Toys R Us and Maplin both collapsing into administration in February. \n \nA House of Fraser spokesman said it was \"business as usual\" at the chain in the UK, adding that the move was \"just a change of ownership\". \n Read More  \nSanpower bought House of Fraser in 2014, but the deal has since proved ill-fated for the Chinese giant, with UK trading under pressure and little success in its plans to launch department stores worldwide. \n \nHouse of Fraser reported a 2.9 per cent fall in sales in the crucial six weeks to December 23, while online sales fell 7.5 per cent after hiccups with the launch of a new web platform. The chain was forced to ask for rent cuts on some of its stores in early January, while also overhauling its supplier base as part of moves to cut costs. \n \nAt the time of the Christmas trading update, Sanpower chairman Yuan Yafei said the Chinese group was \"fully committed to its long-term investment in the UK retail market\". He added Sanpower would continue to provide \"all the necessary support to ensure House of Fraser's success as the leading UK premium department store chain\". \n \nThe group had planned to expand the chain internationally, with 50 House of Frasers planned across China under the name Oriental Fraser. But it has only opened one House of Fraser in China - a store in Nanjing in late 2016. \n Read More  \nOther minority shareholders in House of Fraser include Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley. \n \nNanjing will retain a 38 per cent shareholding in House of Fraser if the deal goes ahead. It said it was still in talks with Wuji Wenhua, but added the firm would be a \"strong strategic equity partner as they possess vast experience in the leisure sector and have access to a large network of travellers\". \n \n\"This additional partnership will help House of Fraser to further internationalise its brand to reach out to an increasingly large international consumer base,\" it added."}

{"articleID":33520272236,"title":"Vitamix Partners with Carbon, TTH for 3D Printing","content":"Carbon’s 3D printing technology has been harnessed by Vitamix , a blending equipment manufacturer, to redesign a micro-fluidic nozzle which rinses and cleans blender containers. \n \nVitamix partnered with Carbon and one of its production partners, The Technology House (TTH) to reimagine how the part could be designed and manufactured. The result is a nozzle able to be mass-produced that is ten times more durable, uses 30% less material, and is around 33% more economical. \n \nTraditionally, the nozzle is comprised of six different injection moulded pieces, which were each made with durable materials able to withstand high pressures and temperatures, and endure exposure to strong cleaning agents, like bleach for example. It was a critical component used to clean and rinse blender containers in commercial shops across the United States. \n \nWith the adoption of Carbon’s Continuous Liquid Interface Production , Vitamix has been able to reduce six separate parts to a single, monolithic part. It is manufactured in 3D printing company’s Rigid Polyurethane (RPU) material, and enabled by the SpeedCella system which comprises the M2 printer and Smart Part Washer system. Due to the high-pressure fluidics performance requirement of the nozzle, complex geometry and channels with excellent surface finish was paramount, but upon receiving the final part, Vitamix says the nozzle is of superior quality than ever before. It is now deploying tens of thousands of the new nozzle design into stores all over the country. \n \n“If you’re going to believe in something that isn’t yet possible, then you have to rethink possible. It’s the only way to get there,” said Jodi Berg, President and CEO, Vitamix. “Our partnership with Carbon is very exciting for us, because it’s helping us rethink the possible every day. Once you realise you can manufacture something differently, then you can think about how those components interact with other components, and how you can achieve an entirely different outcome. It’s about evolving the paradigm of engineering, and now we have a new tool in our toolbox that we’re learning, exploring and evolving.” \n \nFor Carbon, it's another successful implementation of its technology in another vertical market. Already this year the company's partnership with adidas has been built upon and mobile phone case manufacturer, Incase , is bringing Carbon's 3D printing technology into its production processes too. This latest collaboration with Vitamix was announced via Carbon's Twitter account, which also emphasises the company's ambition to shift the utilisation of 3D printing technology from prototyping to manufacturing. An ambition being realised with Vitamix.  \n \n“There is a liberating freedom when designing products on the means of production, and our work with Vitamix is a perfect example of the kind of innovation you can achieve when you fuse design, manufacturability and engineering all into one,” added Joseph DeSimone, CEO and Co-Founder at Carbon. “Once you go digital, you can’t go back – it fundamentally changes how designers and engineers think, how people collaborate and work, without constraints. That’s true of 3D manufacturing, and it’s revolutionary because it allows for powerful, imaginative thinking to solve complex problems and create new opportunities.”"}

In today’s meeting with Fargo Mayor Mahoney, we discussed the progress that is being made as a result of the North Dakota and Minnesota Governors’ task force to help address the issues that folks who are living upstream face. We must continue to stay in contact with Fargo leaders as they work to secure a permit from the state of Minnesota so we can make sure that when the time is right, we can continue efforts to secure the needed federal funding to advance this critical piece of flood protection infrastructure.” \n \nHeitkamp closely monitored the work of the North Dakota and Minnesota Governors’ task force that worked to resolve some of the challenges the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion is facing after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was forced halt construction of the project. The changes made to the project as a result of the task force’s recommendations are a positive step forward to reducing impacts upstream. \n \nHeitkamp has also long fought to make sure the federal government lives up to its responsibilities and assists North Dakota in recovering from past flooding, while also helping protect communities throughout North Dakota from future floods. Heitkamp’s has held conversations with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Army Corps leaders that built on meetings in March of 2017 with OMB and the Army Corps to reinforce the need for continued federal support. \n \nIn April 2017, Heitkamp joined Fargo leaders, the Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority, and the Army Corps to celebrate the groundbreaking of the F-M Diversion. The Army Corps awarded its first construction contract for the diversion in 2016 after Heitkamp successfully secured federal support from OMB and Army Corps leaders for a Fargo construction start , in addition to critical federal funding. \n \nIn October 2016, Heitkamp met with Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney in her ongoing push to guarantee the Red River Valley gets the permanent flood protections the area needs. Heitkamp updated Mahoney on her work to forge a path forward that secures Fargo flood protections, including a conversation she had with then-OMB director Shaun Donovan, pressing him on the need for continued federal support. In July 2016, Heitkamp joined officials in Fargo for the signing of an agreement to initiate construction for the Fargo-Moorhead diversion."}

Credit: Nephron \n  \nMedImmune has expanded the clinical trial protocol for its ongoing Phase I study investigating the safety and efficacy of monalizumab in combination with durvalumab for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). \n \nMedImmune, the R&D arm of AstraZeneca, partnered with immuno-oncology specialist Innate Pharma to examine of the drug combination in patients with advanced solid tumours. Innate contributes monalizumab, its first-in-class anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibody, while AstraZeneca brings durvalumab, its anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. \n \nThe trial’s protocol has been expanded, with new cohorts added testing monalizumab in combination with both durvalumab and standard-of-care treatment in patients with first and second line CRC. \n \nThe dose-escalating portion of the study has already been completed, while the expansion cohorts in selected advanced solid tumours are ongoing. \n \nThe primary objective of the new study arms will be safety, with secondary outcome measures being overall response rate and duration of response, among others. \n \n“We are delighted that our partner MedImmune has decided to further expand the colorectal patient population,” Innate chief medical officer Pierre Dodion said. “We look forward to the first clinical data read-outs from the Phase I study and initial expansion cohort programme during 2018.” \n \nCRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimating that worldwide there are 1.65 million new cases and 835,000 deaths each year. At diagnosis 21% of cases are metastatic, though as in many instances the disease progresses, estimates raise to around 50% following diagnosis. \n \nDurvalumab blocks the interaction of the protein PD-L1 with receptors PD-1 and CD80, countering the immune-evading tactics of tumours and releasing the inhibition of immune responses. The drug is being investigated as a monotherapy and a combination treatment for a number of other diseases such as small cell lung cancer, locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, head and neck cancer and other solid tumours. \n \nMonalizumab targets NKG2A receptors on tumour-infiltrating cytotoxic NK and CD8 T lymphocytes. The drug may re-establish an anti-tumour response mediated by NK and T cells, as well as enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies. \n \nMonalizumab is currently the only checkpoint inhibitor capable of acting simultaneously on T and NK cells, as well as tumour-infiltrating immune cells, offering a more effective immune response. \n \nInnate Pharma currently has four first-in-class antibodies at a clinical stage, including its treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas IPH4102, which is currently in a Phase I trial stage.

The tower will be 360 square feet and 47 feet tall, according to city planning documents.\n\nThirteen local residents came to show their support for the Verizon tower, including several members of the Sanctuary Church.\n\nBrandon Maddux, a youth pastor at the Sanctuary Church, said he had poor reception at his home near the proposed location and his workplace. He spoke of the time his grandfather had a stroke, and cell reception was so poor that his family had to take extra time to use their home phone to call 911.\n\nTom and Gina Thompson touched on how they had incredibly poor cell service reception in their home. Gina Thompson said she and a neighbor who lived two blocks away couldnt even take a call without it dropping every few minutes.\n\n(The tower) will be a profound improvement to our neighborhood and our community, Gina Thompson said.\n\nThree local residents voiced opposition. Resident Caren Knott asked for the commission to postpone approval of the permit to build the Verizon tower, citing concerns about radiation that the site tower could have. She said scientific studies show radiation had increased significantly in recent years, and was concerned the radiation was close to areas where children play.\n\nCommissioner Dennis Ostrom said the commission had done what they could to keep tower locations away from residents and schools. He said he believed the installation was good. Chairperson Lisa Eichman agreed.\n\nThe AT&T tower on 17615 Soledad Canyon Road, near the Antelope Valley Freeway, will be built in Canyon Country Park. It is slated to be a 12-foot wide by 12-foot long and 42-foot tall two-faced clock tower that will have 12 antennas.\n\nThe tower will be located along the southern side of the property, according to city officials.

All vessels are based on new designs developed by Canadian naval architects Robert Allan Ltd., exclusively for Sanmar. \n \n“We have delivered 150 azimuth thrusters to Sanmar in a relationship that spans 15-years,” said Andrea Cerutti, Rolls-Royce Vice-President Customer & Sales, South Europe. “In addition to this, we supplied various equipment to milestone projects such as Borgøy, the world’s first LNG-fuelled tugboat, and the 2017 delivered Svitzer Hermod, the world’s first remotely-controlled commercial vessel. This new contract is another significant milestone in the Rolls-Royce-Sanmar partnership.” \n \nUnlike conventional supply agreements signed on a project-by-project basis, Rolls-Royce and Sanmar have entered into a framework agreement whereby Rolls-Royce will supply standard specification products for all the vessels across a two-to-three-year period. The agreement takes into account options on the standard product specification to cover specific demands and operational requirements. \n \n“This new arrangement provides both parties with some significant advantages,” said Gary Nutter, Rolls-Royce Director Customer & Propulsion. “For Rolls-Royce it provides good visibility, allowing us to optimise production. The benefits for the customer are that we can offer shorter lead times, secure production slots and the flexibility to customise the equipment in line with specific requirements. It’s a win-win arrangement for both parties.” \n \nAli Gurun, Sanmar Projects Director and Member of the Board, added: “The current order book for Sanmar tugs lends itself to this new procurement arrangement. Rather than having to create new supply agreement for each newbuild project, this new arrangement allows to effectively have a constant supply of Rolls-Royce equipment that we can adapt to meet our customers’ requirements. This means we can potentially reduce build time and streamline the building process.” \n \nSanmar’s new portfolio of tug designs has two new additions, a versatile 25m Tractor tug that incorporates a hull that can be outfitted with 60 to 70tonnes Bollard pull and a 29m ASD tug which can accommodate up to 90 tonnes of Bollard pull."}

The decision is conditional on the divestment of Accuride's European business Gianetti Ruote. \n   \nAccuride and Mefro Wheels are both components suppliers for the automotive industry, in particular of steel wheels for buses, trucks and trailers. \n \nThe Commission's competition concerns \n \nThe Commission assessed the impact of the proposed transaction on effective competition in the market for steel wheels for buses and trucks in the European Economic Area (EEA). \n \nThe Commission's investigation confirmed that the proposed transaction, as originally notified, raised the following competition concerns: \n Accuride and Mefro Wheels would have a combined market share of more than 60%, and only one other supplier, Maxion, would remain in the market to compete with the merged entity. As a result, the transaction would have created the largest player on the market and would have significantly limited the choice of suppliers for customers, potentially limiting their capability to resist price increases.  Suppliers not currently present in Europe do not exert sufficient competitive constraint and are not expected to become a significant competitive force in the near future.  \nThe proposed remedy \n \nTo address the Commission's concerns, Accuride offered to divest its European business Gianetti Ruote, an Italian company, to a suitable buyer. \n \nThe proposed remedy maintains the competitive landscape existing before the transaction, with three independent suppliers of steel wheels for buses and trucks. \n \nTherefore, the Commission concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns. The decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments. \n \nCompanies and products \n \nMefro Wheels is a German company that manufactures and supplies steel wheels for passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, commercial vehicles and agriculture and construction machinery. \n \nAccuride is a US company that manufactures and supplies steel and aluminium wheels and wheel-end components such as brake drums, disc brake rotors and slack adjusters for trucks, buses and trailers as well as specialty and military vehicles. In the EEA, Accuride supplies steels wheels for trucks, buses and trailers through its majority-owned Italian subsidiary Gianetti Ruote. \n \nMergers control rules and procedures \n \nThe transaction was notified to the Commission on 12 March 2018. \n \nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation ) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it. \n \nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II). \n \nMore information will be available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number M.8652 . \n  \nIP/18/3582"}

That brings the size of the enlarged site to 2.6 million square feet — equivalent to almost two Shard skyscrapers.\n\nFigures show Westfield London has notched up sales of £8.6 billion and welcomed nearly 250 million visitors since it opened in 2008.\n\nThe centre has helped lead the transformation of White City, which was dominated by the sprawling former headquarters of the BBC. The area will soon have thousands of new homes and a Soho House private members’ club.\n\nWestfield London has recruited an A-list line-up to promote its new expansion, with James Corden, Nigella Lawson, Adwoa Aboah and Miss Piggy fronting its advertising campaign.\n\nThey will help promote the brands opening this week, including cosmetics firm SpaceNK and fashion retailers Adidas and H&M. Customers can also flock to a new John Lewis branch.\n\nIn total there is space for 90 store openings, which will bring total shop and restaurant numbers to 450. Some 8,000 new jobs are being created — with first choice given to local people.\n\nLater in the year Westfield London will welcome Europe’s largest Japanese foodhall Ichiba, mini-golf operator Puttshack, Primark and beauty firms Blink Brow Bar and Molton Brown. Existing tenants such as Monsoon, Ugg and Cath Kidston have agreed to open bigger shops within the extension.\n\nWestfield London’s investment in the capital comes despite a tough retail market, with a number of high street brands facing higher business rates, online competition and customers being squeezed by higher inflation.\n\nThere have also been concerns that the Brexit vote could cause some retailers to freeze or scrap expansion plans.\n\nPeter Miller, chief operating officer of Westfield UK & Europe, told the Evening Standard: “We believe in the resilience of London and with our expansion we are creating west London’s best retail, dining and leisure destination.”\n\nRetail property specialist James Ebel of Harper Dennis Hobbs forecast more brands would be attracted to the area.

XL has also attracted interest from insurers including Germany's Allianz, Bloomberg reported last month. A final deal hasn't been reached and another bidder may yet emerge or talks may fall apart, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for XL Group and Axa didn't respond to several requests for comment. A spokesman for Allianz declined to comment.\n\nBuying XL, which sells insurance to other insurers, would bolster Axa's casualty coverage business in the US, and mark the biggest insurance deal since 2015, according to Bloomberg data. Such firms have become ripe takeover targets as policy prices begin to increase after firms booked heavy losses last year due to a spate of natural disasters. Some $US17.5 billion in deals have been stitched together so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe biggest of the takeovers so far has been American International Group's January agreement to buy Validus Holdings for more than $US5 billion in cash.\n\nXL shares have advanced 23 per cent this year in New York, giving the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company a market value of about $US11 billion. AXA has gained 1.3 per cent in Paris so far this year, valuing the company at €61 billion euros ($96 billion).\n\nXL's Chief Executive Officer Mike McGavick, who expanded the insurer in 2015 with the $US3.9 billion deal to buy Catlin Group, last month said he was optimistic about \"where we are going\" on the back of a solid capital position and growth in premiums.\n\nStill, catastrophe losses might spur more consolidation for Bermuda reinsurers this year, while the US tax overhaul has diluted the pricing advantage the companies enjoyed with Bermuda's low rate, according to a Fitch Ratings report.\n\nAxa's chief executive officer Thomas Buberl, who took the post less than two years ago, has said one of his preferred areas for growth is P&C commercial lines segments. Europe's second largest insurer is shedding some assets as it plans to focus its expansion on fewer countries, with scale being an important factor as he seeks to simplify the business.\n\nThe Paris-based insurer plans to list a minority stake in its US businesses, including its Life & Savings unit and its 64 per cent stake in AllianceBernstein, in the first half of this year.

{"articleID":33545929170,"title":"Klean Athlete® Expands Into Hydration ...","content":"/PRNewswire/ -- Klean Athlete, a line of science-based, NSF Certified for Sport® nutritional supplements, has launched Klean Hydration, an innovative new product designed to maximize hydration and provide athletes with optimal ratios of carbohydrates and minerals before, during and after exercise. Klean Hydration is gluten-free, dairy-free and non-GMO, and it contains no artificial sweeteners, flavors or colors, making it a preferable choice for athletes of all levels seeking to maximize their health and performance without the high sugar content and additives found in many hydration products. \"When you are sweating for longer than an hour, day in and day out, water is far from ideal for maintaining proper hydration status,\" says Kelly Heim, PhD, Senior Director of Scientific Affairs for Klean Athlete, who helped develop Klean Hydration. \"Relying on water alone can result in delayed or impaired fluid absorption and actually diminish an athlete's desire to drink in the late stages of extended exertion. For these reasons, we recommend that athletes opt for a hydration beverage with a balanced mix of carbohydrates and electrolytes.\"\n\nKlean Hydration contains six percent carbohydrates, which research shows is the optimal amount to support athletic performance in a variety of settings. In addition, Klean Hydration contains carefully calculated quantities of essential minerals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium to replace electrolytes lost through sweat during physical activity. The osmotic concentration, or osmolarity, of Klean Hydration is similar to body fluids, allowing it to be well tolerated and maximize hydration efficiency.‡ \n\nKlean Hydration is one of a limited number of NSF Certified for Sport® products to address the sports hydration market. This certification is the gold standard for professional sports organizations, including the NFL, PGA, MLB and NHL, as well as for athletes, coaches and trainers striving to make more informed decisions when choosing sports supplements. Products bearing the NSF Certified for Sport® mark, including Klean Hydration, are independently tested on a lot-by-lot basis for more than 270 substances banned by major athletic organizations. In addition, products are tested for harmful levels of specific contaminants like lead and arsenic. The NSF Certified for Sport® mark also confirms that the contents of the supplement match what is printed on the label, providing athletes with an extra level of assurance about the safety of their nutritional products. \n\n\"Klean Hydration is another example of Klean Athlete's ongoing commitment to clean sport by offering exclusively NSF Certified for Sport® products,\" explained Brian Jordan, RSCC*D, technical manager for NSF Certified for Sport® at NSF International. \"The brand's commitment to developing NSF Certified for Sport® certified nutritional supplements and their expansion into new product categories make it possible for athletes to fuel their bodies without risking the integrity of their performance.\"\n\nProper hydration before, during and after exercise is vital for optimal physical performance and recovery. Even modest dehydration of one percent of body weight can result in diminished exercise capacity. Fluid losses resulting in a two- to three-percent decrease in body weight result in significant physiological stress. In extreme situations, muscle may even be broken down to generate liquid. Klean Hydration should be used to hydrate, maintain electrolyte balance and rehydrate before, during and after exercise.‡ \n\nKlean Hydration is available in a 12.6-ounce canister (MSRP $27.00) and as single-serve sachets (MSRP $19.00 for 10 sachets), providing versatility for athletes on the go. For additional information about Klean Hydration and Klean Athlete's complete line of NSF Certified for Sport® nutritional supplements, please visit kleanathlete.com. \n\nAbout Klean Athlete \n\nKlean Athlete® NSF Certified for Sport® supplements were designed to help athletes maintain a healthy lifestyle and to promote their peak performance, from the weekend warrior to the amateur and professional competitor.‡ Klean Athlete® is available through its exclusive network of accredited coaches, trainers and teams as well as at kleanathlete.com.

And their only winning seasons since came with Jim Harbaugh, whom they controversially fired after he compiled a 44-19-1 record in four seasons.\n\nMariucci and Harbaugh are the only 49ers coaches since George Seifert to have a winning record with the franchise.\n\nAs noted, Mariucci, who led the Lions from 2003-05, is the only one of their last eight fired coaches to become an NFL head coach again. And, obviously, Harbaugh would be quickly hired by an NFL team when or if he decides to leave Michigan.\n\nAs far as the 49ers’ current head coach, Kyle Shanahan, he probably wouldn’t have a problem landing another NFL job if he became unemployed, right?\n\nOf course, fans of a franchise with a mostly miserable recent hiring history hope the answer won’t be provided any time soon.\n\n*************************************** Where Are They Now?\n\nThe 49ers’ seven head coaches before Kyle Shanahan:\n\nChip Kelly (2016): UCLA head coach\n\nJim Tomsula (2015): Washington defensive line coach\n\nJim Harbaugh (2011-14): Michigan head coach\n\nMike Singletary (2008-10): Trinity Christian-Addison head coach\n\nMike Nolan (2005-08): Saints linebackers coach\n\nDennis Erickson (2003-04): Retired (last job: Utah assistant coach)\n\nSteve Mariucci (1997-2002): Retired (last job: Lions head coach)\n\nTwitter: @Eric_Branch"}
{"articleID":33651171660,"title":"Panasonic-TVU Networks sign up for \"powerful\" tech collaboration","content":"A new integration of Panasonic cameras and TVU Networks is set to further their technology collaboration with the introduction of two new video solutions. With these new product integrations, TVU brings in Panasonic to the TVU Grid ecosystem featuring IP video switching, routing and distribution. The Panasonic/TVU integrations will be on display in two locations at the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center during the NAB Show from April 9-12. \n \n“Panasonic has always been a leader in video acquisition, and we’re thrilled to showcase its P2 cameras working seamlessly with our IP-based management and distribution technology at NAB this year,” said Paul Shen, CEO, TVU Networks. “It’s a prime example of creating an easier workflow for our customers, and we’re eager for them to see how easy and powerful the Panasonic/TVU combination is for them. No matter their location, they can acquire and transmit live, low-latency, HD video over IP, and distribute the video with TVU Grid to multiple outlets. In addition, the integration provides an entry into the TVU Grid ecosystem and a part of the largest global video distribution network with over 2500 broadcast stations.” \n \nThe Panasonic AJ-PX270 is a handheld HD camcorder that combines the high quality and efficiency of low bit rate AVC-ULTRA recording and the flexibility of a 3G/4G/LTE wireless mobility. The integration between Panasonic AJ-PX270 P2 cameras and TVU Transceivers enables streaming from a P2 camera directly to a TVU Transceiver via cellular, WiFi or ethernet connection. \n\n“We’re excited to expand our collaboration with TVU Networks to further accelerate remote production workflows and increase quality and efficiency,” explained Delix Joseph T. Alex, product manager, of PTZ Camera & IP Networking Systems at Panasonic. “The new integrations allow for centralization of AVC-ULTRA P2 cameras along-side AW Series PTZ cameras for a very elegant and scalable network video production system, all configurable from anywhere in the world connected to the internet.” \n\nEach Panasonic camera has a unique network ID that communicates to the TVU Transceiver or TVU Command Center, a cloud-based management and control system. The camera provides an IP video stream, thumbnail and status to the Transceiver or Command Center. In addition, a live stream from the Panasonic P2 camera can be triggered, monitored and managed on the TVU Transceiver or TVU Command Center interface. Received P2 streams can then be distributed to other locations via TVU Grid. \n \n\n[[{\"fid\":\"17428\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":564,\"width\":798,\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"},\"link_text\":null}]] \n \nGrid is a scalable IP-based video switching, routing and distribution solution that enables broadcasters to acquire live video from different sources for distribution to other Grid-enabled locations. It is also possible to utilize P2 camera sources with the suite of functions available on the TVU Transceiver or the TVU Cloud service including IP streaming output (direct to Facebook Live, Periscope and other social media services), TVU Producer Pro, TVU Booking Service and more. \n \nIn a separate integration between the two companies, Panasonic’s pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) cameras such as the AW-HE130 can also be paired with TVU Vista, a routing device which provides for the streaming, management and control of IP-based PTZ cameras from remote locations. Ideal for fixed camera deployment such as traffic cameras and beauty shot cameras, Vista aggregates multiple IP connections simultaneously for high bandwidth such as cellular, WiFi, Ethernet, satellite and other IP connections. It also uses TVU’s patented Inverse Statmux + (IS+) technology for stable and resilient transmission over the public Internet. \n \nTVU Vista allows the Panasonic PTZ camera to stream directly from the field back to the studio for decoding and processing using a TVU Transceiver. Once received at the TVU Transceiver, the PTZ camera stream can be distributed via TVU Grid to other locations or streamed to the web using the camera’s IP streaming output or used as a source for Cloud production or Social Media using TVU Producer Pro. Remote camera control for pan, tilt and zoom can easily be done back in the studio using the camera's own control interface."}

{"articleID":33674020862,"title":"The noise won't stop at speedway","content":"/STUFF   \nWestern Springs speedway promoter Greg Mosen says the RFA have not been fair in their dealings with stadium stakeholders. \n   \nOne of Auckland's speedways will be permanently shut in March 2019, ending 90 years of racing at the venue - but that doesn't mean the noise will stop. \n \nWestern Springs Stadium is managed by Regional Facilities Auckland (RFA). \n \nHowever shutting the speedway doesn't mean the noise would stop, in fact it could mean quite the opposite, director of venue development strategy Paul Nisbet said.  \n   \nWestern Springs Speedway promoter Greg Mosen says he will continue to fight to keep speedway where it is. \n   \nThe relocation of speedway events could see the site stage up to 44 special noise events each year compared to the 28 currently permitted. \n \n  \n   \n   \n   \n \nUnder the unitary plan, Western Springs was zoned as a major recreation facility, not zoned as a motorsport precinct.  \n \nIt is proposed that all speedway operations would be moved to Waikaraka Park in Onehunga which was recognised as a designated motorsport precinct within the unitary plan. \n \n\"RFA believes the sport of speedway and the interests of ratepayers will be better served by bringing speedway together in a single regional facility,\" Nisbet said. \n \n\"Since 2012, RFA has invested more than $500,000 as well as staff time and resources in its to efforts to identify a facility for the speedway classes that currently run at Western Springs. Springs Promotion Limited (SPL) has chosen to walk away from those discussions.\" \n \nSpeedway promoter Greg Mosen said Waikaraka was not a viable option given the costs associated with the move.  \n \n\"RFA initially came to a meeting with the Waikaraka people and ourselves and said it's going to cost $40 million to build a purpose built facility at Waikaraka Park. \n \n\"We spent almost a year trying to pin that number back and we managed to get it to $26m. So in order to put us and Waikaraka together it was going to cost the ratepayer $26m. We just don't think that is a good idea.\" \n \nAt the end of May, Auckland Council would vote on the Long Term Plan and part of that would outline exactly what RFA can and can't do. \n \nMosen said he would continue to campaign for a lease extension to avoid cost to the ratepayer.. \n \nWhat exactly would become of the venue would remain unknown until RFA worked through feedback from public consultations, Nesbit said.  \n \nThe public consultation closed earlier this week. \n \nOne of the proposed uses for the stadium would be as a cricket ground catering for international and domestic games, community rugby and as a venue for concerts and festivals.  \n \nThe cost of the revamp necessary to cater for the intended increase in special noise events would become more clear once council agreed on an exact future uses plan, Nesbit said. \n \nA poll run on Neighbourly revealed around 40 per cent of respondents wanted the space to become a public park.  \n \nTwenty per cent voted for a new cricket venue and about 25 per cent said they would like to see the space used for housing.  \n \nMorningside resident Brian Moorwood said the speedway had been a part of his family for generations and didn't want to see it moved to Waikaraka Park. \n \n\"Leave the Speedway where it is. My dad took me, I took my sons and they took my grandchildren. It's an icon of Auckland family life, leave it alone.\" \n \nNesbit said a speedway at Western Springs was simply no longer financially viable. \n \nThe annual cost to RFA of maintaining Western Springs as a venue was about $560,000. \n \n\"This significantly exceeds the venue hire fee that SPL pays to use it for speedway events,\" Nesbit said.  \n \n\"The annual budgeted income from SPL is about $150,000. Any other use will cost the city less and is likely to generate significantly higher utilisation and return on what is a strategic stadium asset for Auckland,\" he said."}
